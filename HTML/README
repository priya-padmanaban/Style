style.html : html code for main part of our website. Has very basic functions but shows what is necessary to work.


csslayout.html : playing around with the html code for formatting. Differences between style.html and csslayout.html 
include border, font color, background color, and border color. All the code we have in style.html also is not in 
csslayout.html
