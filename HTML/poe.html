          Fitzgerald, born in 1896, is considered to be one of the greatest American authors, though he did not achieve much success while he was alive. His masterpiece, 'The Great Gatsby', was not popular until after his death. He achieved fame and wealth from his first book, but since his others did not do well and he had a lavish lifestyle, he was constantly in a lot of debt.
