And/CC when/WRB they/PRP came/VBD quite/RB close/JJ to/TO it/PRP they/PRP found/VBD a/DT great/JJ arch/NN which/WDT must/MD once/RB have/VB had/VBD a/DT gate/NN in/IN it/PRP but/CC was/VBD now/RB almost/RB filled/VBN up/RP with/IN the/DT largest/JJS of/IN all/PDT the/DT apple/NN trees/NNS ./.

They/PRP found/VBD themselves/PRP in/IN a/DT wide/JJ open/JJ place/NN with/IN walls/NNS all/DT round/VBP it/PRP ./. 
In/IN here/RB there/EX were/VBD no/DT trees/NNS ,/, only/RB level/JJ grass/NN and/CC daisies/NNS ,/, and/CC ivy/NN ,/, and/CC grey/NN walls/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT bright/JJ ,/, secret/JJ ,/, quiet/JJ place/NN ,/, and/CC rather/RB sad/JJ ;/: and/CC all/DT four/CD stepped/VBD out/RB into/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, glad/VBZ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO straighten/VB their/PRP$ backs/NNS and/CC move/VB their/PRP$ limbs/NN freely/RB ./.

It/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN the/DT door/NN into/IN the/DT great/JJ hall/NN ./. ''/'' 
``/`` Ages/NNS ago/RB ,/, by/IN the/DT look/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Edmund/NNP ./.

``/`` I/PRP wish/VBP we/PRP could/MD find/VB out/RP who/WP the/DT people/NNS were/VBD that/IN lived/VBN in/IN this/DT castle/NN ;/: and/CC how/WRB long/JJ ago/RB ./. ''/'' 
``/`` It/PRP gives/VBZ me/PRP a/DT queer/NN feeling/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Lucy/NNP ./. 
``/`` Does/VBZ it/PRP ,/, Lu/NNP ?/. ''/''

``/`` Because/IN it/PRP does/VBZ the/DT same/JJ to/TO me/PRP ./.

I/PRP wonder/VBP where/WRB we/PRP are/VBP and/CC what/WP it/PRP all/DT means/VBZ ?/. ''/'' 
While/IN they/PRP were/VBD talking/VBG they/PRP had/VBD crossed/VBN the/DT courtyard/NN and/CC gone/VBN through/IN the/DT other/JJ doorway/NN into/IN what/WP had/VBD once/RB been/VBN the/DT hall/NN ./. 
This/DT was/VBD now/RB very/RB like/IN the/DT courtyard/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT roof/NN had/VBD long/JJ since/IN disappeared/VBN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD merely/RB another/DT space/NN of/IN grass/NN and/CC daisies/NNS ,/, except/IN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD shorter/JJR and/CC narrower/JJR and/CC the/DT walls/NNS were/VBD higher/JJR ./. 
Across/IN the/DT far/RB end/NN there/EX was/VBD a/DT kind/NN of/IN terrace/NN about/IN three/CD feet/NNS higher/RBR than/IN the/DT rest/NN ./.

Anyone/NN would/MD think/VB you/PRP had/VBD forgotten/VBN that/IN we/PRP ourselves/NNS were/VBD once/RB Kings/NNP and/CC Queens/NNP and/CC sat/VBD on/IN a/DT dais/NN just/RB like/IN that/DT ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ great/JJ hall/NN ./. ''/''

``/`` We/PRP could/MD pretend/VB we/PRP were/VBD in/IN Cair/NNP Paravel/NNP now/RB ./.

``/`` It/PRP 's/VBZ getting/VBG late/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ./.

``/`` We/PRP shall/MD need/VB a/DT camp/NN fire/NN if/IN we/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN to/TO spend/VB the/DT night/NN here/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Peter/NNP ./. 
``/`` I/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN matches/NNS ./. 
Let/VB 's/POS go/VB and/CC see/VB if/IN we/PRP can/MD collect/VB some/DT dry/JJ wood/NN ./. ''/'' 
Everyone/NN saw/VBD the/DT sense/NN of/IN this/DT ,/, and/CC for/IN the/DT next/JJ half-hour/NN they/PRP were/VBD busy/JJ ./. 
The/DT orchard/NN through/IN which/WDT they/PRP had/VBD first/JJ come/VBN into/IN the/DT ruins/NNS turned/VBD out/RP not/RB to/TO be/VB a/DT good/JJ place/NN for/IN firewood/NN ./. 
They/PRP tried/VBD the/DT other/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT castle/NN ,/, passing/VBG out/IN of/IN the/DT hall/NN by/IN a/DT little/JJ side/NN door/NN into/IN a/DT maze/NN of/IN stony/NN humps/NNS and/CC hollows/NNS which/WDT must/MD once/RB have/VB been/VBN passages/NNS and/CC smaller/JJR rooms/NNS but/CC was/VBD now/RB all/DT nettles/NNS and/CC wild/JJ roses/NNS ./. 
Beyond/IN this/DT they/PRP found/VBD a/DT wide/JJ gap/NN in/IN the/DT castle/NN wall/NN and/CC stepped/VBD through/IN it/PRP into/IN a/DT wood/NN of/IN darker/NN and/CC bigger/JJR trees/NNS where/WRB they/PRP found/VBD dead/JJ branches/NNS and/CC rotten/VB wood/NN and/CC sticks/NNS and/CC dry/JJ leaves/NNS and/CC fir-cones/NNS in/IN plenty/NN ./. 
They/PRP went/VBD to/TO and/CC fro/VB with/IN bundles/NNS until/IN they/PRP had/VBD a/DT good/JJ pile/NN on/IN the/DT dais/NN ./. 
At/IN the/DT fifth/JJ journey/NN they/PRP found/VBD the/DT well/NN ,/, just/RB outside/IN the/DT hall/NN ,/, hidden/VBN in/IN weeds/NNS ,/, but/CC clean/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ and/CC deep/JJ when/WRB they/PRP had/VBD cleared/VBN these/DT away/RB ./. 
The/DT remains/NNS of/IN a/DT stone/NN pavement/NN ran/VBD half-way/RB round/NN it/PRP ./. 
Then/RB the/DT girls/NNS went/VBD out/IN to/TO pick/VB some/DT more/JJR apples/NNS and/CC the/DT boys/NNS built/VBD the/DT fire/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT dais/NN and/CC fairly/RB close/RB to/TO the/DT corner/NN between/IN two/CD walls/NNS ,/, which/WDT they/PRP thought/VBD would/MD be/VB the/DT snuggest/JJS and/CC warmest/JJS place/NN ./. 
They/PRP had/VBD great/JJ difficulty/NN in/IN lighting/VBG it/PRP and/CC used/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN matches/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP succeeded/VBD in/IN the/DT end/NN ./. 
Finally/RB ,/, all/DT four/CD sat/VBD down/RB with/IN their/PRP$ backs/NNS to/TO the/DT wall/NN and/CC their/PRP$ faces/VBZ to/TO the/DT fire/NN ./. 
They/PRP tried/VBD roasting/VBG some/DT of/IN the/DT apples/NNS on/IN the/DT ends/NNS of/IN sticks/NNS ./. 
But/CC roast/NN apples/NNS are/VBP not/RB much/RB good/JJ without/IN sugar/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP are/VBP too/RB hot/JJ to/TO eat/VB with/IN your/PRP$ fingers/NNS till/IN they/PRP are/VBP too/RB cold/JJ to/TO be/VB worth/JJ eating/VBG ./. 
So/IN they/PRP had/VBD to/TO content/VB themselves/PRP with/IN raw/JJ apples/NNS ,/, which/WDT ,/, as/IN Edmund/NNP said/VBD ,/, made/VBD one/CD realise/NN that/WDT school/NN suppers/NNS were/VBD n't/RB so/RB bad/JJ after/IN all—/NN ''/'' I/PRP should/MD n't/RB mind/VB a/DT good/JJ thick/NN slice/NN of/IN bread/NN and/CC margarine/NN this/DT minute/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP added/VBD ./.

Shortly/RB after/IN the/DT last/JJ apple/NN had/VBD been/VBN eaten/VBN ,/, Susan/NNP went/VBD out/IN to/TO the/DT well/NN to/TO get/VB another/DT drink/NN ./.
