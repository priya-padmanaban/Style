Hans/NNS lifted/VBD up/RP the/DT stone/NN and/CC carried/VBD it/PRP off/RP with/IN a/DT contented/JJ mind/NN ./. 
``/`` I/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN born/VBN under/IN a/DT lucky/JJ star/NN !/. ''/''

``/`` I/PRP have/VBP only/RB to/TO wish/VB for/IN a/DT thing/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ mine/JJ ./. ''/'' 
After/IN a/DT while/NN he/PRP began/VBD to/TO feel/VB rather/RB tired/JJ ,/, as/IN indeed/RB he/PRP had/VBD been/VBN on/IN his/PRP$ legs/NNS since/IN daybreak/NN ;/: he/PRP also/RB began/VBD to/TO feel/VB rather/RB hungry/JJ ,/, as/IN in/IN the/DT fulness/NN of/IN his/PRP$ joy/NN at/IN getting/VBG the/DT cow/NN ,/, he/PRP had/VBD eaten/VBN up/RP all/DT he/PRP had/VBD ./. 
At/IN last/JJ he/PRP could/MD scarcely/RB go/VB on/IN at/IN all/DT ,/, and/CC had/VBD to/TO make/VB a/DT halt/NN every/DT moment/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT stones/NNS weighed/VBD him/PRP down/RP most/JJS unmercifully/RB ,/, and/CC he/PRP could/MD not/RB help/VB wishing/VBG that/IN he/PRP did/VBD not/RB feel/VB obliged/VBN to/TO drag/VB them/PRP along/RP ./. 
And/CC on/IN he/PRP went/VBD at/IN a/DT snail/NN 's/POS pace/NN until/IN he/PRP came/VBD to/TO a/DT well/RB ;/: then/RB he/PRP thought/VBD he/PRP would/MD rest/VB and/CC take/VB a/DT drink/NN of/IN the/DT fresh/JJ water/NN ./. 
And/CC he/PRP placed/VBD the/DT stones/NNS carefully/RB by/IN his/PRP$ side/NN at/IN the/DT edge/NN of/IN the/DT well/NN ;/: then/RB he/PRP sat/VBD down/RB ,/, and/CC as/IN he/PRP stooped/VBD to/TO drink/VB ,/, he/PRP happened/VBD to/TO give/VB the/DT stones/NNS a/DT little/JJ push/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP both/DT fell/VBD into/IN the/DT water/NN with/IN a/DT splash/NN ./. 
And/CC then/RB Hans/NNP ,/, having/VBG watched/VBN them/PRP disappear/VBP ,/, jumped/VBD for/IN joy/NN ,/, and/CC thanked/VBD his/PRP$ stars/NNS that/IN he/PRP had/VBD been/VBN so/RB lucky/JJ as/IN to/TO get/VB rid/JJ of/IN the/DT stones/NNS that/WDT had/VBD weighed/VBN upon/IN him/PRP so/RB long/RB without/IN any/DT effort/NN of/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ ./. 
``/`` I/PRP really/RB think/VBP ,/, ''/'' cried/VBD he/PRP ,/, ``/`` I/PRP am/VBP the/DT luckiest/JJS man/NN under/IN the/DT sun/NN ./. ''/'' 
So/RB on/IN he/PRP went/VBD ,/, void/NN of/IN care/NN ,/, until/IN he/PRP reached/VBD his/PRP$ mother/NN 's/POS house/NN ./. 
Here/RB lived/VBD once/RB an/DT old/JJ Queen/NN ,/, whose/WP$ husband/NN had/VBD been/VBN dead/JJ many/JJ years/NNS ./.

When/WRB the/DT time/NN appointed/VBN for/IN the/DT wedding/NN drew/VBD near/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT old/JJ Queen/NNP had/VBD to/TO send/VB her/PRP$ daughter/NN into/IN the/DT foreign/JJ land/NN ,/, she/PRP got/VBD together/RB many/JJ costly/JJ things/NNS ,/, furniture/NN and/CC cups/NNS and/CC jewels/NNS and/CC adornments/NNS ,/, both/DT of/IN gold/NN and/CC silver/NN ,/, everything/NN proper/NN for/IN the/DT dowry/NN of/IN a/DT royal/NN Princess/NNP ,/, for/IN she/PRP loved/VBD her/PRP daughter/NN dearly/RB ./. 
She/PRP gave/VBD her/PRP also/RB a/DT waiting/VBG gentlewoman/NN to/TO attend/VB her/PRP$ and/CC to/TO give/VB her/PRP into/IN the/DT bridegroom/NN 's/POS hands/NNS ;/: and/CC they/PRP were/VBD each/DT to/TO have/VB a/DT horse/NN for/IN the/DT journey/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT Princess/NNP 's/POS horse/NN was/VBD named/VBN Falada/NNP ,/, and/CC he/PRP could/MD speak/VB ./. 
When/WRB the/DT time/NN for/IN parting/VBG came/VBD ,/, the/DT old/JJ Queen/NNP took/VBD her/PRP$ daughter/NN to/TO her/PRP$ chamber/NN ,/, and/CC with/IN a/DT little/JJ knife/NN she/PRP cut/VBD her/PRP own/JJ finger/NN so/IN that/IN it/PRP bled/VBD ;/: and/CC she/PRP held/VBD beneath/NN it/PRP a/DT white/JJ napkin/NN ,/, and/CC on/IN it/PRP fell/VBD three/CD drops/NNS of/IN blood/NN ;/: and/CC she/PRP gave/VBD it/PRP to/TO her/PRP$ daughter/NN ,/, bidding/VBG her/PRP$ take/NN care/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, for/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB needful/JJ to/TO her/PRP$ on/IN the/DT way/NN ./. 
Then/RB they/PRP took/VBD leave/NN of/IN each/DT other/JJ ;/: and/CC the/DT Princess/NNP put/VBD the/DT napkin/NN in/IN her/PRP$ bosom/NN ,/, got/VBD on/IN her/PRP horse/NN ,/, and/CC set/VBD out/RP to/TO go/VB to/TO the/DT bridegroom/NN ./. 
After/IN she/PRP had/VBD ridden/VBN an/DT hour/NN ,/, she/PRP began/VBD to/TO feel/VB very/RB thirsty/JJ ,/, and/CC she/PRP said/VBD to/TO the/DT waiting-woman/NN ,/, ''/'' Get/NNP down/RB ,/, and/CC fill/VB my/PRP$ cup/NN that/IN you/PRP are/VBP carrying/VBG with/IN water/NN from/IN the/DT brook/NN ;/: I/PRP have/VBP great/JJ desire/NN to/TO drink/VB ./.

``/`` Get/VB down/RP yourself/PRP ,/, ''/'' said/VBD the/DT waiting-woman/NN ,/, ``/`` and/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP thirsty/JJ stoop/NNS down/RP and/CC drink/VB ;/: I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB your/PRP$ slave/NN ./. ''/'' 
And/CC as/IN her/PRP$ thirst/NN was/VBD so/RB great/JJ ,/, the/DT Princess/NNP had/VBD to/TO get/VB down/RB and/CC to/TO stop/VB and/CC drink/VB of/IN the/DT water/NN of/IN the/DT brook/NN ,/, and/CC could/MD not/RB have/VB her/PRP$ gold/JJ cup/NN to/TO serve/VB her/PRP ./. 
``/`` Oh/UH dear/NN !/. ''/''

And/CC the/DT three/CD drops/NNS of/IN blood/NN heard/NN her/PRP ,/, and/CC said/VBD ,/, ''/'' If/IN your/PRP$ mother/NN knew/NN of/IN this/DT ,/, it/PRP would/MD break/VB her/PRP$ heart/NN ./. ''/'' 
But/CC the/DT Princess/NNP answered/VBD nothing/NN ,/, and/CC quietly/RB mounted/VBD her/PRP horse/NN again/RB ./. 
So/IN they/PRP rode/VBP on/IN some/DT miles/NNS farther/RB ;/: the/DT day/NN was/VBD warm/JJ ,/, the/DT sun/NN shone/NN hot/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT Princess/NNP grew/VBD thirsty/JJ once/RB more/RBR ./. 
And/CC when/WRB they/PRP came/VBD to/TO a/DT water-course/JJ she/PRP called/VBD again/RB to/TO the/DT waiting-woman/NN and/CC said/VBD ,/, ''/'' Get/NNP down/RB ,/, and/CC give/VB me/PRP to/TO drink/VB out/IN of/IN my/PRP$ golden/JJ cup/NN ./. ''/'' 
For/IN she/PRP had/VBD forgotten/VBN all/PDT that/DT had/VBD gone/VBN before/RB ./.

So/RB ,/, as/IN her/PRP$ thirst/NN was/VBD so/RB great/JJ ,/, the/DT Princess/NNP had/VBD to/TO get/VB off/RP her/PRP$ horse/NN and/CC to/TO stoop/VB towards/IN the/DT running/JJ water/NN to/TO drink/VB ,/, and/CC as/IN she/PRP stooped/VBD ,/, she/PRP wept/VBD and/CC said/VBD ,/, ``/`` Oh/UH dear/NN !/.

And/CC the/DT three/CD drops/NNS of/IN blood/NN heard/NN her/PRP$ and/CC answered/VBD ,/, ''/'' If/IN your/PRP$ mother/NN knew/NN of/IN this/DT ,/, it/PRP would/MD break/VB her/PRP$ heart/NN !/. ''/'' 
And/CC as/IN she/PRP drank/VBD and/CC stooped/VBD over/IN ,/, the/DT napkin/NN on/IN which/WDT were/VBD the/DT three/CD drops/NNS of/IN blood/NN fell/VBD out/IN of/IN her/PRP$ bosom/NN and/CC floated/VBD down/IN the/DT stream/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN her/PRP$ distress/NN she/PRP never/RB noticed/VBD it/PRP ;/: not/RB so/IN the/DT waiting-woman/JJ ,/, who/WP rejoiced/VBD because/IN she/PRP should/MD have/VB power/NN over/IN the/DT bride/NN ,/, who/WP ,/, now/RB that/IN she/PRP had/VBD lost/VBN the/DT three/CD drops/NNS of/IN blood/NN ,/, had/VBD become/VBN weak/JJ ,/, and/CC unable/JJ to/TO defend/VB herself/PRP ./. 
And/CC when/WRB she/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO mount/VB her/PRP$ horse/NN again/RB the/DT waiting-woman/JJ cried/NN ,/, ''/'' Falada/NNP belongs/VBZ to/TO me/PRP ,/, and/CC this/DT jade/NN to/TO you/PRP ./. ''/'' 
And/CC the/DT Princess/NNP had/VBD to/TO give/VB way/NN and/CC let/VB it/PRP be/VB as/IN she/PRP said/VBD ./. 
Then/RB the/DT waiting-woman/NN ordered/VBD the/DT Princess/NNP with/IN many/JJ hard/JJ words/NNS to/TO take/VB off/RP her/PRP$ rich/JJ clothing/NN and/CC to/TO put/VB on/IN her/PRP plain/NN garments/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB she/PRP made/VBD her/PRP swear/JJ to/TO say/VB nothing/NN of/IN the/DT matter/NN when/WRB they/PRP came/VBD to/TO the/DT royal/JJ court/NN ;/: threatening/VBG to/TO take/VB her/PRP$ life/NN if/IN she/PRP refused/VBD ./.
