In/IN the/DT dark/NN the/DT old/JJ man/NN could/MD feel/VB the/DT morning/NN coming/VBG and/CC as/IN he/PRP rowed/VBD he/PRP heard/VBD the/DT trembling/VBG sound/NN as/IN flying/VBG fish/JJ left/VBD the/DT water/NN and/CC the/DT hissing/NN that/IN their/PRP$ stiff/JJ set/VBN wings/NNS made/VBN as/IN they/PRP soared/VBD away/RB in/IN the/DT darkness/NN ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD very/RB fond/JJ of/IN flying/VBG fish/JJ as/IN they/PRP were/VBD his/PRP$ principal/JJ friends/NNS on/IN the/DT ocean/NN ./.

But/CC the/DT old/JJ man/NN always/RB thought/VBD of/IN her/PRP as/IN feminine/NN and/CC as/IN something/NN that/WDT gave/VBD or/CC withheld/JJ great/JJ favours/NNS ,/, and/CC if/IN she/PRP did/VBD wild/VB or/CC wicked/JJ things/NNS it/PRP was/VBD because/IN she/PRP could/MD not/RB help/VB them/PRP ./. 
The/DT moon/NN affects/VBZ her/PRP as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ a/DT woman/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./.

He/PRP was/VBD letting/VBG the/DT current/JJ do/VBP a/DT third/NN of/IN the/DT work/NN and/CC as/IN it/PRP started/VBD to/TO be/VB light/JJ he/PRP saw/VBD he/PRP was/VBD already/RB further/RB out/RB than/IN he/PRP had/VBD hoped/VBN to/TO be/VB at/IN this/DT hour/NN ./. 
I/PRP worked/VBD the/DT deep/JJ wells/NNS for/IN a/DT week/NN and/CC did/VBD nothing/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Today/NN I/PRP 'll/MD work/VB out/RB where/WRB the/DT schools/NNS of/IN bonita/NN and/CC albacore/NN are/VBP and/CC maybe/RB there/EX will/MD be/VB a/DT big/JJ one/NN with/IN them/PRP ./. 
Before/IN it/PRP was/VBD really/RB light/JJ he/PRP had/VBD his/PRP$ baits/NNS out/RP and/CC was/VBD drifting/VBG with/IN the/DT current/JJ ./. 
One/CD bait/NN was/VBD down/RB forty/JJ fathoms/NNS ./. 
The/DT second/NN was/VBD at/IN seventy-five/JJ and/CC the/DT third/JJ and/CC fourth/JJ were/VBD down/RB in/IN the/DT blue/JJ water/NN at/IN one/CD hundred/CD and/CC one/CD hundred/CD and/CC twenty-five/JJ fathoms/NNS ./. 
Each/DT bait/NN hung/NN head/VBP down/IN with/IN the/DT shank/NN of/IN the/DT hook/NN inside/IN the/DT bait/NN fish/NN ,/, tied/VBN and/CC sewed/VBN solid/JJ and/CC all/PDT the/DT projecting/VBG part/NN of/IN the/DT hook/NN ,/, the/DT curve/NN and/CC the/DT point/NN ,/, was/VBD covered/VBN with/IN fresh/JJ sardines/NNS ./. 
Each/DT sardine/NN was/VBD hooked/VBN through/IN both/DT eyes/NNS so/IN that/IN they/PRP made/VBD a/DT half-garland/NN on/IN the/DT projecting/NN steel/NN ./. 
There/EX was/VBD no/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT hook/NN that/IN a/DT great/JJ fish/NN could/MD feel/VB which/WDT was/VBD not/RB sweet/JJ smelling/NN and/CC good/JJ tasting/NN ./. 
The/DT boy/NN had/VBD given/VBN him/PRP two/CD fresh/JJ small/JJ tunas/NNS ,/, or/CC albacores/NNS ,/, which/WDT hung/VBP on/IN the/DT two/CD deepest/JJS lines/NNS like/IN plummets/NNS and/CC ,/, on/IN the/DT others/NNS ,/, he/PRP had/VBD a/DT big/JJ blue/NN runner/NN and/CC a/DT yellow/JJ jack/NN that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN used/VBN before/IN ;/: but/CC they/PRP were/VBD in/IN good/JJ condition/NN still/RB and/CC had/VBD the/DT excellent/JJ sardines/NNS to/TO give/VB them/PRP scent/NN and/CC attractiveness/NN ./. 
Each/DT line/NN ,/, as/IN thick/JJ around/IN as/IN a/DT big/JJ pencil/NN ,/, was/VBD looped/VBN onto/IN a/DT green-sapped/JJ stick/NN so/IN that/IN any/DT pull/NN or/CC touch/NN on/IN the/DT bait/NN would/MD make/VB the/DT stick/NN dip/NN and/CC each/DT line/NN had/VBD two/CD forty-fathom/NN coils/NNS which/WDT could/MD be/VB made/VBN fast/RB to/TO the/DT other/JJ spare/NN coils/NNS so/RB that/IN ,/, if/IN it/PRP were/VBD necessary/JJ ,/, a/DT fish/NN could/MD take/VB out/RP over/IN three/CD hundred/VBD fathoms/NNS of/IN line/NN ./. 
Now/RB the/DT man/NN watched/VBD the/DT dip/NN of/IN the/DT three/CD sticks/NNS over/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT skiff/NN and/CC rowed/VBD gently/RB to/TO keep/VB the/DT lines/NNS straight/VBD up/RB and/CC down/RB and/CC at/IN their/PRP$ proper/JJ depths/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD quite/RB light/JJ and/CC any/DT moment/NN now/RB the/DT sun/NN would/MD rise/VB ./. 
The/DT sun/NN rose/VBD thinly/RB from/IN the/DT sea/NN and/CC the/DT old/JJ man/NN could/MD see/VB the/DT other/JJ boats/NNS ,/, low/JJ on/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC well/RB in/IN toward/IN the/DT shore/NN ,/, spread/VBD out/RP across/IN the/DT current/JJ ./. 
Then/RB the/DT sun/NN was/VBD brighter/NN and/CC the/DT glare/NN came/VBD on/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC then/RB ,/, as/IN it/PRP rose/VBD clear/JJ ,/, the/DT flat/JJ sea/NN sent/VBD it/PRP back/RP at/IN his/PRP$ eyes/NNS so/IN that/IN it/PRP hurt/VBD sharply/RB and/CC he/PRP rowed/VBD without/IN looking/VBG into/IN it/PRP ./. 
He/PRP looked/VBD down/RB into/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC watched/VBD the/DT lines/NNS that/WDT went/VBD straight/RB down/RB into/IN the/DT dark/NN of/IN the/DT water/NN ./. 
He/PRP kept/VBD them/PRP straighter/JJR than/IN anyone/NN did/VBD ,/, so/IN that/DT at/IN each/DT level/NN in/IN the/DT darkness/NN of/IN the/DT stream/NN there/EX would/MD be/VB a/DT bait/NN waiting/VBG exactly/RB where/WRB he/PRP wished/VBD it/PRP to/TO be/VB for/IN any/DT fish/NN that/IN swam/NN there/RB ./. 
Others/NNS let/VBP them/PRP drift/VB with/IN the/DT current/JJ and/CC sometimes/RB they/PRP were/VBD at/IN sixty/NN fathoms/NNS when/WRB the/DT fishermen/NNS thought/VBD they/PRP were/VBD at/IN a/DT hundred/CD ./. 
But/CC ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ,/, I/PRP keep/VBP them/PRP with/IN precision/NN ./. 
Only/RB I/PRP have/VBP no/DT luck/NN any/DT more/JJR ./. 
But/CC who/WP knows/VBZ ?/.

It/PRP is/VBZ better/RBR to/TO be/VB lucky/JJ ./. 
But/CC I/PRP would/MD rather/RB be/VB exact/JJ ./. 
Then/RB when/WRB luck/NN comes/VBZ you/PRP are/VBP ready/JJ ./. 
The/DT sun/NN was/VBD two/CD hours/NNS higher/RBR now/RB and/CC it/PRP did/VBD not/RB hurt/VB his/PRP$ eyes/NNS so/RB much/JJ to/TO look/VB into/IN the/DT east/NN ./.

All/DT my/PRP$ life/NN the/DT early/JJ sun/NN has/VBZ hurt/VBN my/PRP$ eyes/NNS ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Yet/RB they/PRP are/VBP still/RB good/JJ ./. 
In/IN the/DT evening/NN I/PRP can/MD look/VB straight/RB into/IN it/PRP without/IN getting/VBG the/DT blackness/NN ./. 
It/PRP has/VBZ more/JJR force/NN in/IN the/DT evening/NN too/RB ./. 
But/CC in/IN the/DT morning/NN it/PRP is/VBZ painful/JJ ./. 
Just/RB then/RB he/PRP saw/VBD a/DT man-of-war/JJ bird/NN with/IN his/PRP$ long/JJ black/JJ wings/NNS circling/VBG in/IN the/DT sky/NN ahead/RB of/IN him/PRP ./. 
He/PRP made/VBD a/DT quick/JJ drop/NN ,/, slanting/VBG down/RP on/IN his/PRP$ back-swept/JJ wings/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB circled/VBD again/RB ./. 
``/`` He/PRP 's/VBZ got/VBD something/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT old/JJ man/NN said/VBD aloud/JJ ./.

He/PRP did/VBD not/RB hurry/VB and/CC he/PRP kept/VBD his/PRP$ lines/NNS straight/VBD up/RB and/CC down/RB ./. 
But/CC he/PRP crowded/VBD the/DT current/JJ a/DT little/JJ so/RB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD still/RB fishing/VBG correctly/RB though/IN faster/JJR than/IN he/PRP would/MD have/VB fished/VBN if/IN he/PRP was/VBD not/RB trying/VBG to/TO use/VB the/DT bird/NN ./. 
The/DT bird/NN went/VBD higher/JJR in/IN the/DT air/NN and/CC circled/VBD again/RB ,/, his/PRP$ wings/NNS motionless/NN ./. 
Then/RB he/PRP dove/VB suddenly/RB and/CC the/DT old/JJ man/NN saw/VBD flying/VBG fish/JJ spurt/VBN out/IN of/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC sail/NN desperately/RB over/IN the/DT surface/NN ./. 
``/`` Dolphin/NNP ,/, ''/'' the/DT old/JJ man/NN said/VBD aloud/JJ ./.

He/PRP shipped/VBD his/PRP$ oars/NNS and/CC brought/VBD a/DT small/JJ line/NN from/IN under/IN the/DT bow/NN ./. 
It/PRP had/VBD a/DT wire/NN leader/NN and/CC a/DT medium-sized/JJ hook/NN and/CC he/PRP baited/VBD it/PRP with/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT sardines/NNS ./. 
He/PRP let/VB it/PRP go/VB over/IN the/DT side/NN and/CC then/RB made/VBD it/PRP fast/VBZ to/TO a/DT ring/NN bolt/NN in/IN the/DT stern/NN ./.

As/IN he/PRP watched/VBD the/DT bird/NN dipped/VBD again/RB slanting/VBG his/PRP$ wings/NNS for/IN the/DT dive/NN and/CC then/RB swinging/VBG them/PRP wildly/RB and/CC ineffectually/RB as/IN he/PRP followed/VBD the/DT flying/VBG fish/NN ./. 
The/DT old/JJ man/NN could/MD see/VB the/DT slight/JJ bulge/NN in/IN the/DT water/NN that/IN the/DT big/JJ dolphin/NN raised/VBD as/IN they/PRP followed/VBD the/DT escaping/VBG fish/NN ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT big/JJ school/NN of/IN dolphin/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./.

That/DT school/NN has/VBZ gotten/VBN away/RP from/IN me/PRP ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./.

They/PRP were/VBD moving/VBG more/RBR slowly/RB now/RB and/CC the/DT glow/NN of/IN Havana/NNP was/VBD not/RB so/RB strong/JJ ,/, so/RB that/IN he/PRP knew/VBD the/DT current/JJ must/MD be/VB carrying/VBG them/PRP to/TO the/DT eastward/NN ./. 
If/IN I/PRP lose/VBP the/DT glare/NN of/IN Havana/NNP we/PRP must/MD be/VB going/VBG more/RBR to/TO the/DT eastward/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
For/IN if/IN the/DT fish/NN 's/POS course/NN held/VBD true/JJ I/PRP must/MD see/VB it/PRP for/IN many/JJ more/JJR hours/NNS ./. 
I/PRP wonder/VBP how/WRB the/DT baseball/NN came/VBD out/RP in/IN the/DT grand/JJ leagues/NNS today/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
It/PRP would/MD be/VB wonderful/JJ to/TO do/VB this/DT with/IN a/DT radio/NN ./.

Think/NN of/IN what/WP you/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG ./. 
You/PRP must/MD do/VB nothing/NN stupid/NN ./. 
Then/RB he/PRP said/VBD aloud/NN ,/, ``/`` I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP had/VBD the/DT boy/NN ./.

No/DT one/NN should/MD be/VB alone/RB in/IN their/PRP$ old/JJ age/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ unavoidable/JJ ./. 
I/PRP must/MD remember/VB to/TO eat/VB the/DT tuna/NN before/IN he/PRP spoils/VBZ in/IN order/NN to/TO keep/VB strong/JJ ./.

During/IN the/DT night/NN two/CD porpoise/NN came/VBD around/IN the/DT boat/NN and/CC he/PRP could/MD hear/VB them/PRP rolling/VBG and/CC blowing/NN ./.

``/`` They/PRP are/VBP good/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./.

They/PRP are/VBP our/PRP$ brothers/NNS like/IN the/DT flying/VBG fish/NN ./. ''/'' 
Then/RB he/PRP began/VBD to/TO pity/VB the/DT great/JJ fish/NN that/IN he/PRP had/VBD hooked/VBN ./. 
He/PRP is/VBZ wonderful/JJ and/CC strange/JJ and/CC who/WP knows/VBZ how/WRB old/JJ he/PRP is/VBZ ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Never/RB have/VBP I/PRP had/VBD such/PDT a/DT strong/JJ fish/NN nor/CC one/CD who/WP acted/VBD so/RB strangely/RB ./. 
Perhaps/RB he/PRP is/VBZ too/RB wise/JJ to/TO jump/VB ./. 
He/PRP could/MD ruin/VB me/PRP by/IN jumping/VBG or/CC by/IN a/DT wild/JJ rush/NN ./. 
But/CC perhaps/RB he/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN hooked/VBN many/JJ times/NNS before/RB and/CC he/PRP knows/VBZ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ how/WRB he/PRP should/MD make/VB his/PRP$ fight/NN ./.

He/PRP took/VBD the/DT bait/NN like/IN a/DT male/NN and/CC he/PRP pulls/VBZ like/IN a/DT male/NN and/CC his/PRP$ fight/NN has/VBZ no/DT panic/NN in/IN it/PRP ./. 
I/PRP wonder/VBP if/IN he/PRP has/VBZ any/DT plans/NNS or/CC if/IN he/PRP is/VBZ just/RB as/RB desperate/JJ as/IN I/PRP am/VBP ?/. 
He/PRP remembered/VBD the/DT time/NN he/PRP had/VBD hooked/VBN one/CD of/IN a/DT pair/NN of/IN marlin/NN ./. 
The/DT male/JJ fish/NN always/RB let/VB the/DT female/JJ fish/NN feed/NN first/RB and/CC the/DT hooked/JJ fish/NN ,/, the/DT female/NN ,/, made/VBD a/DT wild/JJ ,/, panic-stricken/JJ ,/, despairing/VBG fight/NN that/WDT soon/RB exhausted/VBD her/PRP ,/, and/CC all/PDT the/DT time/NN the/DT male/NN had/VBD stayed/VBN with/IN her/PRP ,/, crossing/VBG the/DT line/NN and/CC circling/VBG with/IN her/PRP on/IN the/DT surface/NN ./. 
He/PRP had/VBD stayed/VBN so/RB close/JJ that/IN the/DT old/JJ man/NN was/VBD afraid/JJ he/PRP would/MD cut/VB the/DT line/NN with/IN his/PRP$ tail/NN which/WDT was/VBD sharp/JJ as/IN a/DT scythe/NN and/CC almost/RB of/IN that/DT size/NN and/CC shape/NN ./. 
When/WRB the/DT old/JJ man/NN had/VBD gaffed/VBN her/PRP$ and/CC clubbed/VBD her/PRP ,/, holding/VBG the/DT rapier/JJR bill/NN with/IN its/PRP$ sandpaper/NN edge/NN and/CC clubbing/VBG her/PRP$ across/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN her/PRP$ head/NN until/IN her/PRP$ colour/NNS turned/VBD to/TO a/DT colour/NN almost/RB like/IN the/DT backing/NN of/IN mirrors/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT boy/NN 's/POS aid/NN ,/, hoisted/VBD her/PRP aboard/NN ,/, the/DT male/NN fish/NN had/VBD stayed/VBN by/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT boat/NN ./. 
Then/RB ,/, while/IN the/DT old/JJ man/NN was/VBD clearing/VBG the/DT lines/NNS and/CC preparing/VBG the/DT harpoon/NN ,/, the/DT male/JJ fish/NN jumped/VBD high/JJ into/IN the/DT air/NN beside/IN the/DT boat/NN to/TO see/VB where/WRB the/DT female/NN was/VBD and/CC then/RB went/VBD down/RB deep/RB ,/, his/PRP$ lavender/NN wings/NNS ,/, that/WDT were/VBD his/PRP$ pectoral/JJ fins/NNS ,/, spread/JJ wide/JJ and/CC all/DT his/PRP$ wide/JJ lavender/NN stripes/NNS showing/VBG ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD beautiful/JJ ,/, the/DT old/JJ man/NN remembered/VBD ,/, and/CC he/PRP had/VBD stayed/VBN ./. 
That/DT was/VBD the/DT saddest/JJS thing/NN I/PRP ever/RB saw/VBD with/IN them/PRP ,/, the/DT old/JJ man/NN thought/NN ./. 
The/DT boy/NN was/VBD sad/JJ too/RB and/CC we/PRP begged/VBD her/PRP pardon/NN and/CC butchered/VBD her/PRP$ promptly/NN ./. 
``/`` I/PRP wish/VBP the/DT boy/NN was/VBD here/RB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD aloud/JJ and/CC settled/VBD himself/PRP against/IN the/DT rounded/JJ planks/NNS of/IN the/DT bow/NN and/CC felt/VBD the/DT strength/NN of/IN the/DT great/JJ fish/NN through/IN the/DT line/NN he/PRP held/VBD across/IN his/PRP$ shoulders/NNS moving/VBG steadily/RB toward/IN whatever/WDT he/PRP had/VBD chosen/VBN ./. 
When/WRB once/RB ,/, through/IN my/PRP$ treachery/NN ,/, it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN necessary/JJ to/TO him/PRP to/TO make/VB a/DT choice/NN ,/, the/DT old/JJ man/NN thought/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ choice/NN had/VBD been/VBN to/TO stay/VB in/IN the/DT deep/JJ dark/NN water/NN far/RB out/RP beyond/IN all/DT snares/NNS and/CC traps/NNS and/CC treacheries/NNS ./. 
My/PRP$ choice/NN was/VBD to/TO go/VB there/RB to/TO find/VB him/PRP beyond/IN all/DT people/NNS ./. 
Beyond/IN all/DT people/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ./. 
Now/RB we/PRP are/VBP joined/VBN together/RB and/CC have/VBP been/VBN since/IN noon/NN ./. 
And/CC no/DT one/NN to/TO help/VB either/DT one/CD of/IN us/PRP ./. 
Perhaps/RB I/PRP should/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN a/DT fisherman/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
But/CC that/DT was/VBD the/DT thing/NN that/IN I/PRP was/VBD born/VBN for/IN ./. 
I/PRP must/MD surely/RB remember/VB to/TO eat/VB the/DT tuna/NN after/IN it/PRP gets/VBZ light/JJ ./. 
Some/DT time/NN before/IN daylight/JJ something/NN took/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT baits/NNS that/WDT were/VBD behind/IN him/PRP ./. 
He/PRP heard/VBD the/DT stick/JJ break/NN and/CC the/DT line/NN begin/NN to/TO rush/VB out/RP over/IN the/DT gunwale/NN of/IN the/DT skiff/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT darkness/NN he/PRP loosened/VBD his/PRP$ sheath/NN knife/NN and/CC taking/VBG all/PDT the/DT strain/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN on/IN his/PRP$ left/JJ shoulder/NN he/PRP leaned/VBD back/RB and/CC cut/VBD the/DT line/NN against/IN the/DT wood/NN of/IN the/DT gunwale/NN ./. 
Then/RB he/PRP cut/VBD the/DT other/JJ line/NN closest/JJS to/TO him/PRP and/CC in/IN the/DT dark/NN made/VBD the/DT loose/JJ ends/NNS of/IN the/DT reserve/NN coils/VBZ fast/RB ./. 
He/PRP worked/VBD skillfully/RB with/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN and/CC put/VB his/PRP$ foot/NN on/IN the/DT coils/NNS to/TO hold/VB them/PRP as/IN he/PRP drew/VBD his/PRP$ knots/NNS tight/VBD ./. 
Now/RB he/PRP had/VBD six/CD reserve/NN coils/NNS of/IN line/NN ./. 
There/EX were/VBD two/CD from/IN each/DT bait/NN he/PRP had/VBD severed/VBN and/CC the/DT two/CD from/IN the/DT bait/NN the/DT fish/NN had/VBD taken/VBN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD all/DT connected/VBN ./. 
After/IN it/PRP is/VBZ light/JJ ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ,/, I/PRP will/MD work/VB back/RB to/TO the/DT forty-fathom/JJ bait/NN and/CC cut/VB it/PRP away/RB too/RB and/CC link/VB up/RP the/DT reserve/NN coils/NNS ./. 
I/PRP will/MD have/VB lost/VBN two/CD hundred/JJ fathoms/NNS of/IN good/JJ Catalan/NNP cordel/NN and/CC the/DT hooks/NNS and/CC leaders/NNS ./. 
That/DT can/MD be/VB replaced/VBN ./. 
But/CC who/WP replaces/VBZ this/DT fish/JJ if/IN I/PRP hook/VBP some/DT fish/NN and/CC it/PRP cuts/VBZ him/PRP off/RP ?/. 
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP that/IN fish/NN was/VBD that/IN took/VBD the/DT bait/NN just/RB now/RB ./. 
It/PRP could/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT marlin/NN or/CC a/DT broadbill/NN or/CC a/DT shark/NN ./. 
I/PRP never/RB felt/VBD him/PRP ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO get/VB rid/JJ of/IN him/PRP too/RB fast/RB ./. 
Aloud/NNP he/PRP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP had/VBD the/DT boy/NN ./. ''/'' 
But/CC you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB got/VBD the/DT boy/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
You/PRP have/VBP only/RB yourself/PRP and/CC you/PRP had/VBD better/JJR work/NN back/RB to/TO the/DT last/JJ line/NN now/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT dark/NN or/CC not/RB in/IN the/DT dark/NN ,/, and/CC cut/VBD it/PRP away/RB and/CC hook/VB up/RP the/DT two/CD reserve/NN coils/NNS ./. 
So/RB he/PRP did/VBD it/PRP ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD difficult/JJ in/IN the/DT dark/NN and/CC once/RB the/DT fish/NN made/VBD a/DT surge/NN that/WDT pulled/VBD him/PRP down/RP on/IN his/PRP$ face/NN and/CC made/VBD a/DT cut/NN below/IN his/PRP$ eye/NN ./. 
The/DT blood/NN ran/VBD down/RP his/PRP$ cheek/NN a/DT little/JJ way/NN ./. 
But/CC it/PRP coagulated/VBD and/CC dried/VBD before/IN it/PRP reached/VBD his/PRP$ chin/NN and/CC he/PRP worked/VBD his/PRP$ way/NN back/RB to/TO the/DT bow/NN and/CC rested/VBN against/IN the/DT wood/NN ./. 
He/PRP adjusted/VBD the/DT sack/NN and/CC carefully/RB worked/VBD the/DT line/NN so/IN that/IN it/PRP came/VBD across/IN a/DT new/JJ part/NN of/IN his/PRP$ shoulders/NNS and/CC ,/, holding/VBG it/PRP anchored/VBD with/IN his/PRP$ shoulders/NNS ,/, he/PRP carefully/RB felt/VBD the/DT pull/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN and/CC then/RB felt/VBD with/IN his/PRP$ hand/NN the/DT progress/NN of/IN the/DT skiff/NN through/IN the/DT water/NN ./. 
I/PRP wonder/VBP what/WP he/PRP made/VBD that/IN lurch/NN for/IN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
The/DT wire/NN must/MD have/VB slipped/VBN on/IN the/DT great/JJ hill/NN of/IN his/PRP$ back/NN ./. 
Certainly/RB his/PRP$ back/NN can/MD not/RB feel/VB as/RB badly/RB as/IN mine/NN does/VBZ ./. 
But/CC he/PRP can/MD not/RB pull/VB this/DT skiff/NN forever/RB ,/, no/DT matter/NN how/WRB great/JJ he/PRP is/VBZ ./. 
Now/RB everything/NN is/VBZ cleared/VBN away/RP that/IN might/MD make/VB trouble/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP a/DT big/JJ reserve/NN of/IN line/NN ;/: all/PDT that/IN a/DT man/NN can/MD ask/VB ./. 
``/`` Fish/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD softly/RB ,/, aloud/NN ,/, ``/`` I/PRP 'll/MD stay/VB with/IN you/PRP until/IN I/PRP am/VBP dead/JJ ./. ''/'' 
He/PRP 'll/MD stay/VB with/IN me/PRP too/RB ,/, I/PRP suppose/VBP ,/, the/DT old/JJ man/NN thought/NN and/CC he/PRP waited/VBD for/IN it/PRP to/TO be/VB light/JJ ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD cold/VBN now/RB in/IN the/DT time/NN before/IN daylight/NN and/CC he/PRP pushed/VBD against/IN the/DT wood/NN to/TO be/VB warm/JJ ./. 
I/PRP can/MD do/VB it/PRP as/RB long/RB as/IN he/PRP can/MD ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
And/CC in/IN the/DT first/JJ light/VBD the/DT line/NN extended/VBN out/IN and/CC down/RB into/IN the/DT water/NN ./. 
The/DT boat/NN moved/VBD steadily/RB and/CC when/WRB the/DT first/JJ edge/NN of/IN the/DT sun/NN rose/VBD it/PRP was/VBD on/IN the/DT old/JJ man/NN 's/POS right/JJ shoulder/NN ./. 
``/`` He/PRP 's/VBZ headed/VBN north/RB ,/, ''/'' the/DT old/JJ man/NN said/VBD ./.

I/PRP wish/VBP he/PRP would/MD turn/VB with/IN the/DT current/JJ ./. 
That/DT would/MD show/VB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD tiring/VBG ./. 
When/WRB the/DT sun/NN had/VBD risen/VBN further/RB the/DT old/JJ man/NN realized/VBD that/IN the/DT fish/NN was/VBD not/RB tiring/VBG ./. 
There/EX was/VBD only/RB one/CD favorable/JJ sign/NN ./. 
The/DT slant/NN of/IN the/DT line/NN showed/VBD he/PRP was/VBD swimming/VBG at/IN a/DT lesser/JJR depth/NN ./. 
That/DT did/VBD not/RB necessarily/RB mean/VB that/IN he/PRP would/MD jump/VB ./.

``/`` God/NNP let/VBD him/PRP jump/VB ,/, ''/'' the/DT old/JJ man/NN said/VBD ./. 
``/`` I/PRP have/VBP enough/JJ line/NN to/TO handle/VB him/PRP ./. ''/'' 
Maybe/RB if/IN I/PRP can/MD increase/VB the/DT tension/NN just/RB a/DT little/JJ it/PRP will/MD hurt/VB him/PRP and/CC he/PRP will/MD jump/VB ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Now/RB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ daylight/JJ let/NN him/PRP jump/VB so/RB that/IN he/PRP 'll/MD fill/VB the/DT sacks/NNS along/IN his/PRP$ backbone/NN with/IN air/NN and/CC then/RB he/PRP can/MD not/RB go/VB deep/RB to/TO die/VB ./. 
He/PRP tried/VBD to/TO increase/VB the/DT tension/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT line/NN had/VBD been/VBN taut/VBN up/RP to/TO the/DT very/RB edge/NN of/IN the/DT breaking/NN point/NN since/IN he/PRP had/VBD hooked/VBN the/DT fish/NN and/CC he/PRP felt/VBD the/DT harshness/NN as/IN he/PRP leaned/VBD back/RB to/TO pull/VB and/CC knew/VB he/PRP could/MD put/VB no/DT more/JJR strain/NN on/IN it/PRP ./. 
I/PRP must/MD not/RB jerk/VB it/PRP ever/RB ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Each/DT jerk/NN widens/VBZ the/DT cut/NN the/DT hook/NN makes/VBZ and/CC then/RB when/WRB he/PRP does/VBZ jump/VB he/PRP might/MD throw/VB it/PRP ./. 
Anyway/RB I/PRP feel/VBP better/RB with/IN the/DT sun/NN and/CC for/IN once/RB I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB to/TO look/VB into/IN it/PRP ./. 
There/EX was/VBD yellow/JJ weed/NN on/IN the/DT line/NN but/CC the/DT old/JJ man/NN knew/VBD that/IN only/RB made/VBD an/DT added/JJ drag/NN and/CC he/PRP was/VBD pleased/JJ ./.

``/`` Fish/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` I/PRP love/VBP you/PRP and/CC respect/VB you/PRP very/RB much/RB ./.

A/DT small/JJ bird/NN came/VBD toward/IN the/DT skiff/NN from/IN the/DT north/NN ./.

Christ/NN ,/, I/PRP did/VBD not/RB know/VB he/PRP was/VBD so/RB big/JJ ./. ''/'' 
``/`` I/PRP 'll/MD kill/VB him/PRP though/IN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./. 
``/`` In/IN all/DT his/PRP$ greatness/NN and/CC his/PRP$ glory/NN ./. ''/'' 
Although/IN it/PRP is/VBZ unjust/JJ ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
But/CC I/PRP will/MD show/VB him/PRP what/WP a/DT man/NN can/MD do/VB and/CC what/VB a/DT man/NN endures/VBZ ./. 
``/`` I/PRP told/VBD the/DT boy/NN I/PRP was/VBD a/DT strange/JJ old/JJ man/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./. 
``/`` Now/RB is/VBZ when/WRB I/PRP must/MD prove/VB it/PRP ./. ''/'' 
The/DT thousand/CD times/NNS that/IN he/PRP had/VBD proved/VBN it/PRP meant/VBD nothing/NN ./. 
Now/RB he/PRP was/VBD proving/VBG it/PRP again/RB ./. 
Each/DT time/NN was/VBD a/DT new/JJ time/NN and/CC he/PRP never/RB thought/VBD about/IN the/DT past/NN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD doing/VBG it/PRP ./. 
I/PRP wish/VBP he/PRP 'd/MD sleep/VB and/CC I/PRP could/MD sleep/VB and/CC dream/VB about/IN the/DT lions/NNS ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Why/WRB are/VBP the/DT lions/NNS the/DT main/JJ thing/NN that/WDT is/VBZ left/VBN ?/. 
Do/VBP n't/RB think/VB ,/, old/JJ man/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD to/TO himself/PRP ./. 
Rest/NNP gently/RB now/RB against/IN the/DT wood/NN and/CC think/NN of/IN nothing/NN ./. 
He/PRP is/VBZ working/VBG ./. 
Work/NN as/RB little/JJ as/IN you/PRP can/MD ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD getting/VBG into/IN the/DT afternoon/NN and/CC the/DT boat/NN still/RB moved/VBD slowly/RB and/CC steadily/RB ./. 
But/CC there/EX was/VBD an/DT added/JJ drag/NN now/RB from/IN the/DT easterly/JJ breeze/NN and/CC the/DT old/JJ man/NN rode/VBZ gently/RB with/IN the/DT small/JJ sea/NN and/CC the/DT hurt/NN of/IN the/DT cord/NN across/IN his/PRP$ back/NN came/VBD to/TO him/PRP easily/RB and/CC smoothly/RB ./. 
Once/RB in/IN the/DT afternoon/NN the/DT line/NN started/VBD to/TO rise/VB again/RB ./. 
But/CC the/DT fish/NN only/RB continued/VBD to/TO swim/VB at/IN a/DT slightly/RB higher/JJR level/NN ./. 
The/DT sun/NN was/VBD on/IN the/DT old/JJ man/NN 's/POS left/JJ arm/NN and/CC shoulder/NN and/CC on/IN his/PRP$ back/NN ./. 
So/RB he/PRP knew/VBD the/DT fish/NN had/VBD turned/VBN east/RB of/IN north/NN ./. 
Now/RB that/IN he/PRP had/VBD seen/VBN him/PRP once/RB ,/, he/PRP could/MD picture/VB the/DT fish/JJ swimming/NN in/IN the/DT water/NN with/IN his/PRP$ purple/JJ pectoral/JJ fins/NNS set/VBN wide/JJ as/IN wings/NNS and/CC the/DT great/JJ erect/JJ tail/NN slicing/VBG through/IN the/DT dark/NN ./. 
I/PRP wonder/VBP how/WRB much/RB he/PRP sees/VBZ at/IN that/DT depth/NN ,/, the/DT old/JJ man/NN thought/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ eye/NN is/VBZ huge/JJ and/CC a/DT horse/NN ,/, with/IN much/JJ less/JJR eye/NN ,/, can/MD see/VB in/IN the/DT dark/NN ./. 
Once/RB I/PRP could/MD see/VB quite/RB well/RB in/IN the/DT dark/NN ./. 
Not/RB in/IN the/DT absolute/NN dark/NN ./. 
But/CC almost/RB as/IN a/DT cat/NN sees/VBZ ./. 
The/DT sun/NN and/CC his/PRP$ steady/JJ movement/NN of/IN his/PRP$ fingers/NNS had/VBD uncramped/VBN his/PRP$ left/JJ hand/NN now/RB completely/RB and/CC he/PRP began/VBD to/TO shift/VB more/JJR of/IN the/DT strain/NN to/TO it/PRP and/CC he/PRP shrugged/VBD the/DT muscles/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ back/NN to/TO shift/VB the/DT hurt/NN of/IN the/DT cord/NN a/DT little/JJ ./. 
``/`` If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB tired/VBN ,/, fish/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD aloud/NN ,/, ``/`` you/PRP must/MD be/VB very/RB strange/JJ ./. ''/'' 
He/PRP felt/VBD very/RB tired/VBN now/RB and/CC he/PRP knew/VBD the/DT night/NN would/MD come/VB soon/RB and/CC he/PRP tried/VBD to/TO think/VB of/IN other/JJ things/NNS ./. 
He/PRP thought/VBD of/IN the/DT Big/NNP Leagues/NNP ,/, to/TO him/PRP they/PRP were/VBD the/DT Gran/NNP Ligas/NNP ,/, and/CC he/PRP knew/VBD that/IN the/DT Yankees/NNS of/IN New/NNP York/NNP were/VBD playing/VBG the/DT Tigres/NNPS of/IN Detroit/NNP ./.
