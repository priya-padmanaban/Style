TO/IN THE/NNP RED/NNP COUNTRY/NNP and/CC part/NN of/IN the/DT gray/JJ country/NN of/IN Oklahoma/NNP ,/, the/DT last/JJ rains/NNS came/VBD gently/RB ,/, and/CC they/PRP did/VBD not/RB cut/VB the/DT scarred/JJ earth/NN ./. 
The/DT plows/NNS crossed/VBD and/CC recrossed/VBD the/DT rivulet/NN marks/NNS ./. 
The/DT last/JJ rains/NNS lifted/VBD the/DT corn/NN quickly/RB and/CC scattered/VBD weed/NN colonies/NNS and/CC grass/NN along/IN the/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT roads/NNS so/RB that/IN the/DT gray/JJ country/NN and/CC the/DT dark/NN red/JJ country/NN began/VBD to/TO disappear/VB under/IN a/DT green/JJ cover/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT last/JJ part/NN of/IN May/NNP the/DT sky/NN grew/VBD pale/JJ and/CC the/DT clouds/NN that/WDT had/VBD hung/VBN in/IN high/JJ puffs/NNS for/IN so/RB long/RB in/IN the/DT spring/NN were/VBD dissipated/VBN ./. 
The/DT sun/NN flared/VBD down/RB on/IN the/DT growing/VBG corn/NN day/NN after/IN day/NN until/IN a/DT line/NN of/IN brown/JJ spread/NN along/IN the/DT edge/NN of/IN each/DT green/JJ bayonet/NN ./. 
The/DT clouds/NN appeared/VBD ,/, and/CC went/VBD away/RB ,/, and/CC in/IN a/DT while/NN they/PRP did/VBD not/RB try/VB any/DT more/JJR ./. 
The/DT weeds/NNS grew/VBD darker/NN green/NN to/TO protect/VB themselves/PRP ,/, and/CC they/PRP did/VBD not/RB spread/VB any/DT more/JJR ./. 
The/DT surface/NN of/IN the/DT earth/NN crusted/VBD ,/, a/DT thin/JJ hard/JJ crust/NN ,/, and/CC as/IN the/DT sky/NN became/VBD pale/JJ ,/, so/IN the/DT earth/NN became/VBD pale/JJ ,/, pink/VB in/IN the/DT red/JJ country/NN and/CC white/JJ in/IN the/DT gray/JJ country/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT water-cut/JJ gullies/NNS the/DT earth/NN dusted/VBD down/RB in/IN dry/JJ little/JJ streams/NNS ./. 
Gophers/NNS and/CC ant/JJ lions/NNS started/VBD small/JJ avalanches/NNS ./. 
And/CC as/IN the/DT sharp/JJ sun/JJ struck/VBD day/NN after/IN day/NN ,/, the/DT leaves/NNS of/IN the/DT young/JJ corn/NN became/VBD less/JJR stiff/JJ and/CC erect/VBP ;/: they/PRP bent/VBP in/IN a/DT curve/NN at/IN first/JJ ,/, and/CC then/RB ,/, as/IN the/DT central/JJ ribs/NN of/IN strength/NN grew/VBD weak/JJ ,/, each/DT leaf/NN tilted/VBN downward/RB ./. 
Then/RB it/PRP was/VBD June/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT sun/NN shone/NN more/RBR fiercely/RB ./. 
The/DT brown/JJ lines/NNS on/IN the/DT corn/NN leaves/VBZ widened/VBN and/CC moved/VBN in/IN on/IN the/DT central/JJ ribs/NN ./. 
The/DT weeds/NNS frayed/VBN and/CC edged/VBN back/RB toward/IN their/PRP$ roots/NNS ./. 
The/DT air/NN was/VBD thin/JJ and/CC the/DT sky/NN more/JJR pale/JJ ;/: and/CC every/DT day/NN the/DT earth/NN paled/VBD ./. 
In/IN the/DT roads/NNS where/WRB the/DT teams/NNS moved/VBD ,/, where/WRB the/DT wheels/NNS milled/VBD the/DT ground/NN and/CC the/DT hooves/NNS of/IN the/DT horses/NNS beat/VBP the/DT ground/NN ,/, the/DT dirt/NN crust/NN broke/VBD and/CC the/DT dust/NN formed/VBN ./. 
Every/DT moving/VBG thing/NN lifted/VBD the/DT dust/NN into/IN the/DT air/NN :/: a/DT walking/VBG man/NN lifted/VBD a/DT thin/JJ layer/NN as/RB high/JJ as/IN his/PRP$ waist/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT wagon/NN lifted/VBD the/DT dust/NN as/RB high/JJ as/IN the/DT fence/NN tops/NNS ,/, and/CC an/DT automobile/NN boiled/VBD a/DT cloud/NN behind/IN it/PRP ./. 
The/DT dust/NN was/VBD long/RB in/IN settling/VBG back/RB again/RB ./. 
When/WRB June/NNP was/VBD half/NN gone/VBN ,/, the/DT big/JJ clouds/NN moved/VBD up/RB out/IN of/IN Texas/NNP and/CC the/DT Gulf/NNP ,/, high/JJ heavy/JJ clouds/NNS ,/, rainheads/NNS ./. 
The/DT men/NNS in/IN the/DT fields/NNS looked/VBD up/RP at/IN the/DT clouds/NN and/CC sniffed/NN at/IN them/PRP and/CC held/VBD wet/NN fingers/NNS up/RB to/TO sense/VB the/DT wind/NN ./. 
And/CC the/DT horses/NNS were/VBD nervous/JJ while/IN the/DT clouds/NNS were/VBD up/RB ./. 
The/DT rainheads/NNS dropped/VBD a/DT little/JJ spattering/NN and/CC hurried/VBN on/IN to/TO some/DT other/JJ country/NN ./. 
Behind/IN them/PRP the/DT sky/NN was/VBD pale/JJ again/RB and/CC the/DT sun/NN flared/VBD ./. 
In/IN the/DT dust/NN there/EX were/VBD drop/NN craters/NNS where/WRB the/DT rain/NN had/VBD fallen/VBN ,/, and/CC there/EX were/VBD clean/JJ splashes/NNS on/IN the/DT corn/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT was/VBD all/DT ./. 
A/DT gentle/JJ wind/NN followed/VBD the/DT rain/NN clouds/NN ,/, driving/VBG them/PRP on/IN northward/NN ,/, a/DT wind/NN that/WDT softly/RB clashed/VBD the/DT drying/VBG corn/NN ./. 
A/DT day/NN went/VBD by/IN and/CC the/DT wind/NN increased/VBD ,/, steady/JJ ,/, unbroken/JJ by/IN gusts/NNS ./. 
The/DT dust/NN from/IN the/DT roads/NNS fluffed/VBD up/RP and/CC spread/VB out/RB and/CC fell/VBD on/IN the/DT weeds/NNS beside/VBP the/DT fields/NNS ,/, and/CC fell/VBD into/IN the/DT fields/NNS a/DT little/JJ way/NN ./. 
Now/RB the/DT wind/NN grew/VBD strong/JJ and/CC hard/JJ and/CC it/PRP worked/VBD at/IN the/DT rain/NN crust/NN in/IN the/DT corn/NN fields/NNS ./. 
Little/JJ by/IN little/JJ the/DT sky/NN was/VBD darkened/VBN by/IN the/DT mixing/NN dust/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT wind/NN felt/VBD over/IN the/DT earth/NN ,/, loosened/VBD the/DT dust/NN ,/, and/CC carried/VBD it/PRP away/RB ./. 
The/DT wind/NN grew/VBD stronger/JJR ./. 
The/DT rain/NN crust/NN broke/VBD and/CC the/DT dust/NN lifted/VBD up/RP out/IN of/IN the/DT fields/NNS and/CC drove/VB gray/JJ plumes/NNS into/IN the/DT air/NN like/IN sluggish/JJ smoke/NN ./. 
The/DT corn/NN threshed/VBD the/DT wind/NN and/CC made/VBD a/DT dry/JJ ,/, rushing/VBG sound/NN ./. 
The/DT finest/JJS dust/NN did/VBD not/RB settle/VB back/RB to/TO earth/NN now/RB ,/, but/CC disappeared/VBD into/IN the/DT darkening/NN sky/NN ./. 
The/DT wind/NN grew/VBD stronger/JJR ,/, whisked/VBN under/IN stones/NNS ,/, carried/VBD up/RP straws/NNS and/CC old/JJ leaves/NNS ,/, and/CC even/RB little/JJ clods/NNS ,/, marking/VBG its/PRP$ course/NN as/IN it/PRP sailed/VBD across/IN the/DT fields/NNS ./. 
The/DT air/NN and/CC the/DT sky/NN darkened/VBD and/CC through/IN them/PRP the/DT sun/NN shone/NN redly/RB ,/, and/CC there/RB was/VBD a/DT raw/JJ sting/NN in/IN the/DT air/NN ./. 
During/IN a/DT night/NN the/DT wind/NN raced/VBD faster/RBR over/IN the/DT land/NN ,/, dug/JJ cunningly/RB among/IN the/DT rootlets/NNS of/IN the/DT corn/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT corn/NN fought/VBD the/DT wind/NN with/IN its/PRP$ weakened/JJ leaves/NNS until/IN the/DT roots/NNS were/VBD freed/VBN by/IN the/DT prying/NN wind/NN and/CC then/RB each/DT stalk/NN settled/VBD wearily/RB sideways/RB toward/IN the/DT earth/NN and/CC pointed/VBD the/DT direction/NN of/IN the/DT wind/NN ./. 
The/DT dawn/NN came/VBD ,/, but/CC no/DT day/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT gray/JJ sky/NN a/DT red/JJ sun/NN appeared/VBD ,/, a/DT dim/NN red/JJ circle/NN that/WDT gave/VBD a/DT little/JJ light/JJ ,/, like/IN dusk/NN ;/: and/CC as/IN that/DT day/NN advanced/VBD ,/, the/DT dusk/NN slipped/VBD back/RB toward/IN darkness/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT wind/NN cried/VBD and/CC whimpered/VBD over/IN the/DT fallen/VBN corn/NN ./. 
Men/NN and/CC women/NNS huddled/VBD in/IN their/PRP$ houses/NNS ,/, and/CC they/PRP tied/VBD handkerchiefs/NNS over/IN their/PRP$ noses/NNS when/WRB they/PRP went/VBD out/RP ,/, and/CC wore/VBD goggles/NNS to/TO protect/VB their/PRP$ eyes/NNS ./. 
When/WRB the/DT night/NN came/VBD again/RB it/PRP was/VBD black/JJ night/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT stars/NNS could/MD not/RB pierce/VB the/DT dust/NN to/TO get/VB down/RP ,/, and/CC the/DT window/NN lights/NNS could/MD not/RB even/RB spread/VB beyond/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ yards/NNS ./. 
Now/RB the/DT dust/NN was/VBD evenly/RB mixed/JJ with/IN the/DT air/NN ,/, an/DT emulsion/NN of/IN dust/NN and/CC air/NN ./. 
Houses/NNS were/VBD shut/JJ tight/JJ ,/, and/CC cloth/RB wedged/VBN around/IN doors/NNS and/CC windows/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT dust/NN came/VBD in/IN so/RB thinly/RB that/IN it/PRP could/MD not/RB be/VB seen/VBN in/IN the/DT air/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP settled/VBD like/JJ pollen/NN on/IN the/DT chairs/NNS and/CC tables/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT dishes/NNS ./. 
The/DT people/NNS brushed/VBD it/PRP from/IN their/PRP$ shoulders/NNS ./. 
Little/JJ lines/NNS of/IN dust/NN lay/NN at/IN the/DT door/NN sills/NNS ./. 
In/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN that/DT night/NN the/DT wind/NN passed/VBD on/IN and/CC left/VBD the/DT land/NN quiet/NN ./. 
The/DT dust-filled/JJ air/NN muffled/VBD sound/RB more/RBR completely/RB than/IN fog/NN does/VBZ ./. 
The/DT people/NNS ,/, lying/VBG in/IN their/PRP$ beds/NNS ,/, heard/VBD the/DT wind/NN stop/NN ./. 
They/PRP awakened/VBD when/WRB the/DT rushing/NN wind/NN was/VBD gone/VBN ./. 
They/PRP lay/VBD quietly/RB and/CC listened/JJ deep/NN into/IN the/DT stillness/NN ./. 
Then/RB the/DT roosters/NNS crowed/VBD ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ voices/NNS were/VBD muffled/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT people/NNS stirred/VBD restlessly/RB in/IN their/PRP$ beds/NNS and/CC wanted/VBD the/DT morning/NN ./. 
They/PRP knew/VBD it/PRP would/MD take/VB a/DT long/JJ time/NN for/IN the/DT dust/NN to/TO settle/VB out/IN of/IN the/DT air/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT morning/NN the/DT dust/NN hung/NN like/IN fog/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT sun/NN was/VBD as/RB red/JJ as/IN ripe/JJ new/JJ blood/NN ./. 
All/DT day/NN the/DT dust/NN sifted/VBD down/RB from/IN the/DT sky/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT next/JJ day/NN it/PRP sifted/VBD down/RB ./. 
An/DT even/RB blanket/NN covered/VBD the/DT earth/NN ./. 
It/PRP settled/VBD on/IN the/DT corn/NN ,/, piled/VBD up/RP on/IN the/DT tops/NNS of/IN the/DT fence/NN posts/NNS ,/, piled/VBD up/RP on/IN the/DT wires/NNS ;/: it/PRP settled/VBD on/IN roofs/NN ,/, blanketed/VBD the/DT weeds/NNS and/CC trees/NNS ./. 
The/DT people/NNS came/VBD out/IN of/IN their/PRP$ houses/NNS and/CC smelled/VBD the/DT hot/JJ stinging/NN air/NN and/CC covered/VBD their/PRP$ noses/NNS from/IN it/PRP ./. 
And/CC the/DT children/NNS came/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT houses/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP did/VBD not/RB run/VB or/CC shout/VB as/IN they/PRP would/MD have/VB done/VBN after/IN a/DT rain/NN ./. 
Men/NN stood/VBD by/IN their/PRP$ fences/NNS and/CC looked/VBD at/IN the/DT ruined/JJ corn/NN ,/, drying/VBG fast/RB now/RB ,/, only/RB a/DT little/JJ green/JJ showing/VBG through/IN the/DT film/NN of/IN dust/NN ./. 
The/DT men/NNS were/VBD silent/JJ and/CC they/PRP did/VBD not/RB move/VB often/RB ./. 
And/CC the/DT women/NNS came/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT houses/NNS to/TO stand/VB beside/VB their/PRP$ men—to/NN feel/VB whether/IN this/DT time/NN the/DT men/NNS would/MD break/VB ./. 
The/DT women/NNS studied/VBD the/DT men/NNS 's/POS faces/VBZ secretly/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT corn/NN could/MD go/VB ,/, as/RB long/RB as/IN something/NN else/RB remained/VBD ./. 
The/DT children/NNS stood/VBD near/IN by/IN ,/, drawing/VBG figures/NNS in/IN the/DT dust/NN with/IN bare/NN toes/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT children/NNS sent/VBD exploring/VBG senses/NNS out/RP to/TO see/VB whether/IN men/NNS and/CC women/NNS would/MD break/VB ./. 
The/DT children/NNS peeked/VBD at/IN the/DT faces/VBZ of/IN the/DT men/NNS and/CC women/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB drew/VBD careful/JJ lines/NNS in/IN the/DT dust/NN with/IN their/PRP$ toes/NNS ./. 
Horses/NNS came/VBD to/TO the/DT watering/NN troughs/NNS and/CC nuzzled/VBD the/DT water/NN to/TO clear/VB the/DT surface/NN dust/NN ./. 
After/IN a/DT while/IN the/DT faces/VBZ of/IN the/DT watching/VBG men/NNS lost/VBD their/PRP$ bemused/JJ perplexity/NN and/CC became/VBD hard/JJ and/CC angry/JJ and/CC resistant/JJ ./.

The/DT women/NNS knew/VBD it/PRP was/VBD all/DT right/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT watching/NN children/NNS knew/VBD it/PRP was/VBD all/DT right/NN ./.

The/DT women/NNS went/VBD into/IN the/DT houses/NNS to/TO their/PRP$ work/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT children/NNS began/VBD to/TO play/VB ,/, but/CC cautiously/RB at/IN first/JJ ./. 
As/IN the/DT day/NN went/VBD forward/RB the/DT sun/NN became/VBD less/RBR red/JJ ./. 
It/PRP flared/VBD down/RB on/IN the/DT dust-blanketed/JJ land/NN ./. 
The/DT men/NNS sat/VBD in/IN the/DT doorways/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ houses/NNS ;/: their/PRP$ hands/NNS were/VBD busy/JJ with/IN sticks/NNS and/CC little/JJ rocks/NNS ./. 
The/DT men/NNS sat/VBD still—thinking—figuring/VBG ./. 
A/DT HUGE/NNP RED/NNP TRANSPORT/NNP truck/NN stood/VBD in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT little/JJ roadside/JJ restaurant/NN ./. 
The/DT vertical/JJ exhaust/NN pipe/NN muttered/VBD softly/RB ,/, and/CC an/DT almost/RB invisible/JJ haze/NN of/IN steel-blue/JJ smoke/NN hovered/VBD over/IN its/PRP$ end/NN ./.

A/DT small/JJ outlet/NN fan/NN turned/VBD silently/RB in/IN its/PRP$ circular/JJ hole/NN over/IN the/DT entrance/NN ,/, and/CC flies/NNS buzzed/VBN excitedly/RB about/IN the/DT doors/NNS and/CC windows/NNS ,/, butting/VBG the/DT screens/NNS ./.
