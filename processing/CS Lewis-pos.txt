A/DT moment/NN later/RB she/PRP found/VBD that/IN she/PRP was/VBD standing/VBG in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN a/DT wood/NN at/IN night-time/JJ with/IN snow/JJ under/IN her/PRP$ feet/NNS and/CC snowflakes/NNS falling/VBG through/IN the/DT air/NN ./.

``/`` I/PRP can/MD always/RB get/VB back/RB if/IN anything/NN goes/VBZ wrong/JJ ,/, ''/'' thought/VBD Lucy/NNP ./.

In/IN about/RB ten/JJ minutes/NNS she/PRP reached/VBD it/PRP and/CC found/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT lamp-post/NN ./.

And/CC soon/RB after/IN that/IN a/DT very/RB strange/JJ person/NN stepped/VBD out/IN from/IN among/IN the/DT trees/NNS into/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT lamp-post/NN ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD only/RB a/DT little/JJ taller/NN than/IN Lucy/NNP herself/PRP and/CC he/PRP carried/VBD over/IN his/PRP$ head/NN an/DT umbrella/NN ,/, white/JJ with/IN snow/NN ./.

Lucy/NNP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO boarding/VBG school/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./.
