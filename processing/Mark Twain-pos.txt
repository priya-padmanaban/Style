London/NNP was/VBD fifteen/JJ hundred/CD years/NNS old/JJ ,/, and/CC was/VBD a/DT great/JJ town—for/NN that/DT day/NN ./. 
It/PRP had/VBD a/DT hundred/VBN thousand/CD inhabitants—some/JJ think/VBP double/JJ as/IN many/JJ ./. 
The/DT streets/NNS were/VBD very/RB narrow/JJ ,/, and/CC crooked/VBD ,/, and/CC dirty/NN ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT part/NN where/WRB Tom/NNP Canty/NNP lived/VBD ,/, which/WDT was/VBD not/RB far/RB from/IN London/NNP Bridge/NNP ./. 
The/DT houses/NNS were/VBD of/IN wood/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT second/JJ story/NN projecting/NN over/IN the/DT first/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT third/JJ sticking/VBG its/PRP$ elbows/NNS out/RP beyond/IN the/DT second/JJ ./. 
The/DT higher/JJR the/DT houses/NNS grew/VBD ,/, the/DT broader/NN they/PRP grew/VBD ./. 
They/PRP were/VBD skeletons/NNS of/IN strong/JJ criss-cross/JJ beams/NNS ,/, with/IN solid/JJ material/NN between/IN ,/, coated/VBN with/IN plaster/NN ./. 
The/DT beams/NNS were/VBD painted/VBN red/JJ or/CC blue/JJ or/CC black/JJ ,/, according/VBG to/TO the/DT owner/NN ’/NNP s/VBZ taste/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT gave/VBD the/DT houses/NNS a/DT very/RB picturesque/JJ look/NN ./.

The/DT house/NN which/WDT Tom/NNP ’/NNP s/VBD father/RB lived/VBN in/IN was/VBD up/RP a/DT foul/JJ little/JJ pocket/NN called/VBN Offal/NNP Court/NNP ,/, out/IN of/IN Pudding/VBG Lane/NNP ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD small/JJ ,/, decayed/VBN ,/, and/CC rickety/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD packed/VBN full/JJ of/IN wretchedly/RB poor/JJ families/NNS ./. 
Canty/NNP ’/NNP s/VBD tribe/RB occupied/VBN a/DT room/NN on/IN the/DT third/JJ floor/NN ./. 
The/DT mother/NN and/CC father/NN had/VBD a/DT sort/NN of/IN bedstead/NN in/IN the/DT corner/NN ;/: but/CC Tom/NNP ,/, his/PRP$ grandmother/NN ,/, and/CC his/PRP$ two/CD sisters/NNS ,/, Bet/NNP and/CC Nan/NNP ,/, were/VBD not/RB restricted—they/VBN had/VBD all/DT the/DT floor/NN to/TO themselves/PRP ,/, and/CC might/MD sleep/VB where/WRB they/PRP chose/VBD ./. 
There/EX were/VBD the/DT remains/NNS of/IN a/DT blanket/NN or/CC two/CD ,/, and/CC some/DT bundles/NNS of/IN ancient/NN and/CC dirty/JJ straw/NN ,/, but/CC these/DT could/MD not/RB rightly/RB be/VB called/VBN beds/NNS ,/, for/IN they/PRP were/VBD not/RB organised/VBN ;/: they/PRP were/VBD kicked/VBN into/IN a/DT general/JJ pile/NN ,/, mornings/NNS ,/, and/CC selections/NNS made/VBN from/IN the/DT mass/NN at/IN night/NN ,/, for/IN service/NN ./. 
Bet/NNP and/CC Nan/NNP were/VBD fifteen/JJ years/NNS old—twins/VBZ ./. 
They/PRP were/VBD good-hearted/JJ girls/NNS ,/, unclean/JJ ,/, clothed/VBN in/IN rags/NN ,/, and/CC profoundly/RB ignorant/JJ ./. 
Their/PRP$ mother/NN was/VBD like/IN them/PRP ./. 
But/CC the/DT father/NN and/CC the/DT grandmother/NN were/VBD a/DT couple/NN of/IN fiends/NNS ./.

They/PRP made/VBD beggars/NNS of/IN the/DT children/NNS ,/, but/CC failed/VBD to/TO make/VB thieves/NNS of/IN them/PRP ./.

All/DT Offal/NNP Court/NNP was/VBD just/RB such/JJ another/DT hive/NN as/IN Canty/NNP ’/NNP s/NN house/NN ./.

No/DT ,/, Tom/NNP ’/NNP s/VBD life/NN went/VBD along/RB well/RB enough/RB ,/, especially/RB in/IN summer/NN ./. 
He/PRP only/RB begged/VBD just/RB enough/RB to/TO save/VB himself/PRP ,/, for/IN the/DT laws/NNS against/IN mendicancy/NN were/VBD stringent/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT penalties/NNS heavy/VBP ;/: so/RB he/PRP put/VBD in/IN a/DT good/JJ deal/NN of/IN his/PRP$ time/NN listening/VBG to/TO good/JJ Father/NNP Andrew/NNP ’/NNP s/VBD charming/VBG old/JJ tales/NNS and/CC legends/VBZ about/IN giants/NNS and/CC fairies/NNS ,/, dwarfs/NN and/CC genii/NN ,/, and/CC enchanted/VBD castles/NNS ,/, and/CC gorgeous/JJ kings/NNS and/CC princes/NNS ./. 
His/PRP$ head/NN grew/VBD to/TO be/VB full/JJ of/IN these/DT wonderful/JJ things/NNS ,/, and/CC many/JJ a/DT night/NN as/IN he/PRP lay/VBD in/IN the/DT dark/NN on/IN his/PRP$ scant/NN and/CC offensive/JJ straw/NN ,/, tired/VBN ,/, hungry/JJ ,/, and/CC smarting/VBG from/IN a/DT thrashing/NN ,/, he/PRP unleashed/VBD his/PRP$ imagination/NN and/CC soon/RB forgot/VBD his/PRP$ aches/NNS and/CC pains/NNS in/IN delicious/JJ picturings/NNS to/TO himself/PRP of/IN the/DT charmed/JJ life/NN of/IN a/DT petted/JJ prince/NN in/IN a/DT regal/JJ palace/NN ./.

The/DT cells/NNS were/VBD all/DT crowded/VBN ;/: so/RB the/DT two/CD friends/NNS were/VBD chained/VBN in/IN a/DT large/JJ room/NN where/WRB persons/NNS charged/VBN with/IN trifling/VBG offences/NNS were/VBD commonly/RB kept/VBN ./.

The/DT King/NNP chafed/VBD bitterly/RB over/IN the/DT stupendous/JJ indignity/NN thus/RB put/VBD upon/IN his/PRP$ royalty/NN ,/, but/CC Hendon/NNP was/VBD moody/NN and/CC taciturn/NN ./.
