Mrs./NNP Bennet/NNP 's/POS schemes/NNS for/IN this/DT day/NN were/VBD ineffectual/JJ ./. 
Bingley/NNP was/VBD every/DT thing/NN that/WDT was/VBD charming/VBG ,/, except/IN the/DT professed/JJ lover/NN of/IN her/PRP$ daughter/NN ./.

Elizabeth/NNP ,/, who/WP had/VBD a/DT letter/NN to/TO write/VB ,/, went/VBD into/IN the/DT breakfast/NN room/NN for/IN that/DT purpose/NN soon/RB after/IN tea/NN ;/: for/IN as/IN the/DT others/NNS were/VBD all/DT going/VBG to/TO sit/VB down/RP to/TO cards/NNS ,/, she/PRP could/MD not/RB be/VB wanted/VBN to/TO counteract/VB her/PRP$ mother/NN 's/POS schemes/NNS ./.

About/IN thirty/CD years/NNS ago/RB Miss/NNP Maria/NNP Ward/NNP ,/, of/IN Huntingdon/NNP ,/, with/IN only/RB seven/CD thousand/CD pounds/NNS ,/, had/VBD the/DT good/JJ luck/NN to/TO captivate/VB Sir/NNP Thomas/NNP Bertram/NNP ,/, of/IN Mansfield/NNP Park/NNP ,/, in/IN the/DT county/NN of/IN Northampton/NNP ,/, and/CC to/TO be/VB thereby/RB raised/VBN to/TO the/DT rank/NN of/IN a/DT baronet/NN 's/POS lady/NN ,/, with/IN all/PDT the/DT comforts/NNS and/CC consequences/NNS of/IN an/DT handsome/JJ house/NN and/CC large/JJ income/NN ./.
