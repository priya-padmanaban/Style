The/DT very/RB few/JJ glasses/NNS of/IN Lafitte/NNP that/IN I/PRP had/VBD sipped/VBN had/VBD the/DT effect/NN of/IN rendering/VBG me/PRP drowsy/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP felt/VBD inclined/JJ to/TO take/VB a/DT nap/NN of/IN some/DT fifteen/NN or/CC twenty/NN minutes/NNS ,/, as/IN is/VBZ my/PRP$ custom/NN after/IN dinner/NN ./.

While/IN I/PRP stood/VBD bewildered/VBN at/IN the/DT suddenness/NN of/IN this/DT accident/NN (/( which/WDT might/MD have/VB happened/VBN ,/, nevertheless/RB ,/, to/TO anyone/NN under/IN the/DT sun/NN )/) ,/, and/CC while/IN I/PRP still/RB continued/VBD incapable/JJ of/IN sight/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD accosted/VBN by/IN the/DT Angel/NNP of/IN the/DT Odd/NNP ,/, who/WP proffered/VBD me/PRP his/PRP$ aid/NN with/IN a/DT civility/NN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD no/DT reason/NN to/TO expect/VB ./. 
He/PRP examined/VBD my/PRP$ disordered/JJ eye/NN with/IN much/JJ gentleness/NN and/CC skill/NN ,/, informed/VBD me/PRP that/IN I/PRP had/VBD a/DT drop/NN in/IN it/PRP ,/, and/CC (/( whatever/VB a/DT ``/`` drop/NN ''/'' was/VBD )/) took/VBD it/PRP out/RP ,/, and/CC afforded/VBD me/PRP relief/NN ./. 
I/PRP now/RB considered/VBD it/PRP high/JJ time/NN to/TO die/VB (/( since/IN fortune/NN had/VBD so/RB determined/VBN to/TO persecute/VB me/PRP )/) ,/, and/CC accordingly/RB made/VBD my/PRP$ way/NN to/TO the/DT nearest/JJS river/NN ./. 
Here/RB ,/, divesting/VBG myself/PRP of/IN my/PRP$ clothes/NNS (/( for/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT reason/NN why/WRB we/PRP can/MD not/RB die/VB as/IN we/PRP were/VBD born/VBN )/) ,/, I/PRP threw/VBD myself/PRP headlong/RB into/IN the/DT current/JJ ;/: the/DT sole/JJ witness/NN of/IN my/PRP$ fate/NN being/VBG a/DT solitary/JJ crow/NN that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN seduced/VBN into/IN the/DT eating/NN of/IN brandy-saturated/JJ corn/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB had/VBD staggered/VBN away/RB from/IN his/PRP$ fellows/NNS ./. 
No/DT sooner/NN had/VBD I/PRP entered/VBD the/DT water/NN than/IN this/DT bird/NN took/VBD it/PRP into/IN his/PRP$ head/NN to/TO fly/VB away/RB with/IN the/DT most/RBS indispensable/JJ portion/NN of/IN my/PRP$ apparel/NN ./. 
Postponing/VBG ,/, therefore/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT present/JJ ,/, my/PRP$ suicidal/JJ design/NN ,/, I/PRP just/RB slipped/VBD my/PRP$ nether/JJ extremities/NNS into/IN the/DT sleeves/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ coat/NN ,/, and/CC betook/VB myself/PRP to/TO a/DT pursuit/NN of/IN the/DT felon/NN with/IN all/PDT the/DT nimbleness/NN which/WDT the/DT case/NN required/VBN and/CC its/PRP$ circumstances/NNS would/MD admit/VB ./. 
But/CC my/PRP$ evil/JJ destiny/NN attended/VBD me/PRP still/RB ./. 
As/IN I/PRP ran/VBP at/IN full/JJ speed/NN ,/, with/IN my/PRP$ nose/JJ up/RP in/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN ,/, and/CC intent/NN only/RB upon/IN the/DT purloiner/NN of/IN my/PRP$ property/NN ,/, I/PRP suddenly/RB perceived/VBD that/IN my/PRP$ feet/NNS rested/VBD no/RB longer/RBR upon/IN terra/JJ firma/NN ;/: the/DT fact/NN is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP had/VBD thrown/VBN myself/PRP over/IN a/DT precipice/NN ,/, and/CC should/MD inevitably/RB have/VB been/VBN dashed/VBN to/TO pieces/NNS but/CC for/IN my/PRP$ good/JJ fortune/NN in/IN grasping/VBG the/DT end/NN of/IN a/DT long/JJ guide-rope/NN ,/, which/WDT depended/VBD from/IN a/DT passing/NN balloon/NN ./. 
As/RB soon/RB as/IN I/PRP sufficiently/RB recovered/VBD my/PRP$ senses/NNS to/TO comprehend/VB the/DT terrific/JJ predicament/NN in/IN which/WDT I/PRP stood/VBD ,/, or/CC rather/RB hung/NN ,/, I/PRP exerted/VBD all/PDT the/DT power/NN of/IN my/PRP$ lungs/NNS to/TO make/VB that/DT predicament/NN known/VBN to/TO the/DT aeronaut/JJ overhead/NN ./. 
But/CC for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN I/PRP exerted/VBD myself/PRP in/IN vain/NN ./. 
Either/CC the/DT fool/NN could/MD not/RB ,/, or/CC the/DT villain/NN would/MD not/RB perceive/VB me/PRP ./. 
Meanwhile/RB the/DT machine/NN rapidly/RB soared/VBD ,/, while/IN my/PRP$ strength/NN even/RB more/RBR rapidly/RB failed/VBD ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD soon/RB upon/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN resigning/VBG myself/PRP to/TO my/PRP$ fate/NN ,/, and/CC dropping/VBG quietly/RB into/IN the/DT sea/NN ,/, when/WRB my/PRP$ spirits/NNS were/VBD suddenly/RB revived/VBN by/IN hearing/VBG a/DT hollow/JJ voice/NN from/IN above/IN ,/, which/WDT seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB lazily/RB humming/VBG an/DT opera/NN air/NN ./. 
Looking/VBG up/RP ,/, I/PRP perceived/VBD the/DT Angel/NNP of/IN the/DT Odd/NNP ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD leaning/VBG ,/, with/IN his/PRP$ arms/NNS folded/VBD ,/, over/IN the/DT rim/NN of/IN the/DT car/NN ;/: and/CC with/IN a/DT pipe/NN in/IN his/PRP$ mouth/NN ,/, at/IN which/WDT he/PRP puffed/VBD leisurely/RB ,/, seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB upon/JJ excellent/JJ terms/NNS with/IN himself/PRP and/CC the/DT universe/NN ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD too/RB much/JJ exhausted/VBN to/TO speak/VB ,/, so/IN I/PRP merely/RB regarded/VBD him/PRP with/IN an/DT imploring/VBG air/NN ./. 
During/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN a/DT dull/NN ,/, dark/NN ,/, and/CC soundless/JJ day/NN in/IN the/DT autumn/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT clouds/NN hung/NN oppressively/RB low/JJ in/IN the/DT heavens/NNS ,/, I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN passing/VBG alone/RB ,/, on/IN horseback/NN ,/, through/IN a/DT singularly/JJ dreary/JJ tract/NN of/IN country/NN ;/: and/CC at/IN length/NN found/VBD myself/PRP ,/, as/IN the/DT shades/NNS of/IN the/DT evening/NN drew/NN on/IN ,/, within/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT melancholy/JJ House/NNP of/IN Usher/NNP ./. 
I/PRP know/VBP not/RB how/WRB it/PRP was/VBD ;/: but/CC ,/, with/IN the/DT first/JJ glimpse/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN ,/, a/DT sense/NN of/IN insufferable/JJ gloom/NN pervaded/VBD my/PRP$ spirit/NN ./. 
I/PRP say/VBP insufferable/JJ ;/: for/IN the/DT feeling/NN was/VBD unrelieved/VBN by/IN any/DT of/IN that/DT half-pleasurable/JJ ,/, because/IN poetic/JJ ,/, sentiment/NN ,/, with/IN which/WDT the/DT mind/NN usually/RB receives/VBZ even/RB the/DT sternest/JJS natural/JJ images/NNS of/IN the/DT desolate/NN or/CC terrible/JJ ./. 
I/PRP looked/VBD upon/IN the/DT scene/NN before/IN me—upon/NN the/DT mere/JJ house/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT simple/JJ landscape/NN features/NNS of/IN the/DT domain—upon/NN the/DT bleak/JJ walls—upon/IN the/DT vacant/JJ eye-like/JJ windows—a/NN few/JJ rank/NN sedges—and/NN upon/IN a/DT few/JJ white/JJ trunks/NNS of/IN decayed/NN trees—with/NN an/DT utter/JJ depression/NN of/IN soul/NN which/WDT I/PRP can/MD compare/VB to/TO no/DT earthly/JJ sensation/NN more/RBR properly/RB than/IN to/TO the/DT after-dream/NN of/IN the/DT reveller/NN upon/IN opium—the/JJ bitter/NN lapse/NN into/IN everyday/JJ life—the/VBP hideous/JJ dropping/VBG off/IN of/IN the/DT veil/NN ./. 
There/EX was/VBD an/DT iciness/NN ,/, a/DT sinking/NN ,/, a/DT sickening/NN of/IN the/DT heart—an/NN unredeemed/VBD dreariness/NN of/IN thought/NN which/WDT no/DT goading/NN of/IN the/DT imagination/NN could/MD torture/VB into/IN aught/NN of/IN the/DT sublime/NN ./. 
What/WP was/VBD it—I/RB paused/VBN to/TO think—what/DT was/VBD it/PRP that/IN so/RB unnerved/JJ me/PRP in/IN the/DT contemplation/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Usher/NNP ?/. 
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT mystery/NN all/DT insoluble/JJ ;/: nor/CC could/MD I/PRP grapple/VB with/IN the/DT shadowy/NN fancies/VBZ that/IN crowded/VBD upon/RB me/PRP as/IN I/PRP pondered/VBD ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD forced/VBN to/TO fall/VB back/RB upon/IN the/DT unsatisfactory/JJ conclusion/NN that/IN while/IN ,/, beyond/IN doubt/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP combinations/NNS of/IN very/RB simple/JJ natural/JJ objects/NNS which/WDT have/VBP the/DT power/NN of/IN thus/RB affecting/VBG us/PRP ,/, still/RB the/DT analysis/NN of/IN this/DT power/NN lies/VBZ among/IN considerations/NNS beyond/IN our/PRP$ depth/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD possible/JJ ,/, I/PRP reflected/VBD ,/, that/IN a/DT mere/JJ different/JJ arrangement/NN of/IN the/DT particulars/NNS of/IN the/DT scene/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT details/NNS of/IN the/DT picture/NN ,/, would/MD be/VB sufficient/JJ to/TO modify/VB ,/, or/CC perhaps/RB to/TO annihilate/VB its/PRP$ capacity/NN for/IN sorrowful/JJ impression/NN ;/: and/CC ,/, acting/VBG upon/IN this/DT idea/NN ,/, I/PRP reined/VBD my/PRP$ horse/NN to/TO the/DT precipitous/JJ brink/NN of/IN a/DT black/JJ and/CC lurid/JJ tarn/NN [/VBD 3/CD ]/NN that/WDT lay/VBD in/IN unruffled/JJ lustre/NN by/IN the/DT dwelling/NN ,/, and/CC gazed/VBD down—but/NN with/IN a/DT shudder/JJR even/RB more/RBR thrilling/JJ than/IN before—upon/IN the/DT remodelled/JJ and/CC inverted/JJ images/NNS of/IN the/DT gray/JJ sedge/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT ghastly/RB tree/JJ stems/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT vacant/JJ and/CC eye-like/JJ windows/NNS ./. 
Nevertheless/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT mansion/NN of/IN gloom/NN I/PRP now/RB proposed/VBD to/TO myself/VB a/DT sojourn/NN of/IN some/DT weeks/NNS ./. 
Its/PRP$ proprietor/NN ,/, Roderick/NNP Usher/NNP ,/, had/VBD been/VBN one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ boon/NN companions/NNS in/IN boyhood/NN ;/: but/CC many/JJ years/NNS had/VBD elapsed/VBN since/IN our/PRP$ last/JJ meeting/NN ./. 
A/DT letter/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, had/VBD lately/RB reached/VBN me/PRP in/IN a/DT distant/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT country—a/JJ letter/NN from/IN him—which/NN ,/, in/IN its/PRP$ wildly/JJ importunate/JJ nature/NN ,/, had/VBD admitted/VBN of/IN no/DT other/JJ than/IN a/DT personal/JJ reply/NN ./. 
The/DT Ms./NNP gave/VBD evidence/NN of/IN nervous/JJ agitation/NN ./. 
The/DT writer/NN spoke/NN of/IN acute/JJ bodily/RB illness/NN ,/, of/IN a/DT mental/JJ disorder/NN which/WDT oppressed/VBD him/PRP ,/, and/CC of/IN an/DT earnest/NN desire/NN to/TO see/VB me/PRP ,/, as/IN his/PRP$ best/JJS ,/, and/CC indeed/RB his/PRP$ only/RB ,/, personal/JJ friend/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT view/NN of/IN attempting/VBG ,/, by/IN the/DT cheerfulness/NN of/IN my/PRP$ society/NN ,/, some/DT alleviation/NN of/IN his/PRP$ malady/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD the/DT manner/NN in/IN which/WDT all/PDT this/DT ,/, and/CC much/RB more/JJR ,/, was/VBD said—it/NN was/VBD the/DT apparent/JJ heart/NN that/WDT went/VBD with/IN his/PRP$ request—which/NN allowed/VBD me/PRP no/DT room/NN for/IN hesitation/NN ;/: and/CC I/PRP accordingly/RB obeyed/VBD forthwith/VB what/WP I/PRP still/RB considered/VBD a/DT very/RB singular/JJ summons/NNS ./. 
Although/IN ,/, as/IN boys/NNS ,/, we/PRP had/VBD been/VBN even/RB intimate/JJ associates/NNS ,/, yet/RB I/PRP really/RB knew/VBD little/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ reserve/NN had/VBD been/VBN always/RB excessive/JJ and/CC habitual/JJ ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD aware/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN his/PRP$ very/RB ancient/JJ family/NN had/VBD been/VBN noted/VBN ,/, time/NN out/IN of/IN mind/NN ,/, for/IN a/DT peculiar/JJ sensibility/NN of/IN temperament/NN ,/, displaying/VBG itself/PRP ,/, through/IN long/JJ ages/NNS ,/, in/IN many/JJ works/NNS of/IN exalted/JJ art/NN ,/, and/CC manifested/VBD ,/, of/IN late/JJ ,/, in/IN repeated/JJ deeds/NNS of/IN munificent/NN ,/, yet/RB unobtrusive/JJ ,/, charity/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN in/IN a/DT passionate/NN devotion/NN to/TO the/DT intricacies/NNS ,/, perhaps/RB even/RB more/JJR than/IN to/TO the/DT orthodox/NN and/CC easily/RB recognizable/JJ beauties/NNS ,/, of/IN musical/JJ science/NN ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD learned/VBN ,/, too/RB ,/, the/DT very/RB remarkable/JJ fact/NN that/IN the/DT stem/NN of/IN the/DT Usher/NNP race/NN ,/, all/DT time-honored/JJ as/IN it/PRP was/VBD ,/, had/VBD put/VBN forth/RB ,/, at/IN no/DT period/NN ,/, any/DT enduring/VBG branch/NN ;/: in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, that/IN the/DT entire/JJ family/NN lay/NN in/IN the/DT direct/JJ line/NN of/IN descent/NN ,/, and/CC had/VBD always/RB ,/, with/IN very/RB trifling/VBG and/CC very/RB temporary/JJ variation/NN ,/, so/RB lain/JJ ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD this/DT deficiency/NN ,/, I/PRP considered/VBD ,/, while/IN running/VBG over/RP in/IN thought/VBN the/DT perfect/JJ keeping/VBG of/IN the/DT character/NN of/IN the/DT premises/NNS with/IN the/DT accredited/JJ character/NN of/IN the/DT people/NNS ,/, and/CC while/IN speculating/VBG upon/IN the/DT possible/JJ influence/NN which/WDT the/DT one/CD ,/, in/IN the/DT long/JJ lapse/NN of/IN centuries/NNS ,/, might/MD have/VB exercised/VBN upon/IN the/DT other—it/NN was/VBD this/DT deficiency/NN ,/, perhaps/RB ,/, of/IN collateral/JJ issue/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT consequent/NN undeviating/VBG transmission/NN ,/, from/IN sire/NN to/TO son/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT patrimony/NN with/IN the/DT name/NN ,/, which/WDT had/VBD ,/, at/IN length/NN ,/, so/RB identified/VBN the/DT two/CD as/IN to/TO merge/VB the/DT original/JJ title/NN of/IN the/DT estate/NN in/IN the/DT quaint/NN and/CC equivocal/JJ appellation/NN of/IN the/DT House/NNP of/IN Usher—an/NNP appellation/NN which/WDT seemed/VBD to/TO include/VB ,/, in/IN the/DT minds/NNS of/IN the/DT peasantry/NN who/WP used/VBD it/PRP ,/, both/CC the/DT family/NN and/CC the/DT family/NN mansion/NN ./. 
I/PRP have/VBP said/VBD that/IN the/DT sole/JJ effect/NN of/IN my/PRP$ somewhat/FW childish/JJ experiment/NN of/IN looking/VBG down/RP within/IN the/DT tarn/NN had/VBD been/VBN to/TO deepen/VB the/DT first/JJ singular/JJ impression/NN ./. 
There/EX can/MD be/VB no/DT doubt/NN that/IN the/DT consciousness/NN of/IN the/DT rapid/JJ increase/NN of/IN my/PRP$ superstition—for/JJ why/WRB should/MD I/PRP not/RB so/RB term/NN it/PRP ?/. —served/VBD mainly/RB to/TO accelerate/VB the/DT increase/NN itself/PRP ./. 
Such/JJ ,/, I/PRP have/VBP long/RB known/VBN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT paradoxical/JJ law/NN of/IN all/DT sentiments/NNS having/VBG terror/NN as/IN a/DT basis/NN ./. 
And/CC it/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN for/IN this/DT reason/NN only/RB ,/, that/IN ,/, when/WRB I/PRP again/RB uplifted/VBD my/PRP$ eyes/NNS to/TO the/DT house/NN itself/PRP ,/, from/IN its/PRP$ image/NN in/IN the/DT pool/NN ,/, there/EX grew/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ mind/NN a/DT strange/JJ fancy—a/NN fancy/NN so/RB ridiculous/JJ ,/, indeed/RB ,/, that/IN I/PRP but/CC mention/NN it/PRP to/TO show/VB the/DT vivid/JJ force/NN of/IN the/DT sensations/NNS which/WDT oppressed/VBD me/PRP ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD so/RB worked/VBN upon/IN my/PRP$ imagination/NN as/IN really/RB to/TO believe/VB that/IN about/IN the/DT whole/JJ mansion/NN and/CC domain/NN there/RB hung/VBZ an/DT atmosphere/NN peculiar/JJ to/TO themselves/PRP and/CC their/PRP$ immediate/JJ vicinity—an/NNS atmosphere/RB which/WDT had/VBD no/DT affinity/NN with/IN the/DT air/NN of/IN heaven/NN ,/, but/CC which/WDT had/VBD reeked/VBN up/RP from/IN the/DT decayed/NN trees/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT gray/JJ wall/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT silent/JJ tarn—a/NN pestilent/NN and/CC mystic/JJ vapor/NN ,/, dull/NN ,/, sluggish/JJ ,/, faintly/RB discernible/JJ ,/, and/CC leaden-hued/JJ ./. 
Shaking/VBG off/RP from/IN my/PRP$ spirit/NN what/WP must/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT dream/NN ,/, I/PRP scanned/VBD more/RBR narrowly/RB the/DT real/JJ aspect/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN ./. 
Its/PRP$ principal/JJ feature/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB that/IN of/IN an/DT excessive/JJ antiquity/NN ./. 
The/DT discoloration/NN of/IN ages/NNS had/VBD been/VBN great/JJ ./. 
Minute/NNP fungi/NNS overspread/VBP the/DT whole/JJ exterior/NN ,/, hanging/VBG in/IN a/DT fine/JJ ,/, tangled/VBD web-work/NN from/IN the/DT eaves/NNS ./. 
Yet/RB all/PDT this/DT was/VBD apart/RB from/IN any/DT extraordinary/JJ dilapidation/NN ./. 
No/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT masonry/NN had/VBD fallen/VBN ;/: and/CC there/RB appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT wild/JJ inconsistency/NN between/IN its/PRP$ still/RB perfect/JJ adaptation/NN of/IN parts/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT crumbling/VBG condition/NN of/IN the/DT individual/JJ stones/NNS ./. 
In/IN this/DT there/EX was/VBD much/JJ that/IN reminded/VBD me/PRP of/IN the/DT specious/JJ totality/NN of/IN old/JJ woodwork/NN which/WDT has/VBZ rotted/VBN for/IN years/NNS in/IN some/DT neglected/JJ vault/NN ,/, with/IN no/DT disturbance/NN from/IN the/DT breath/NN of/IN the/DT external/JJ air/NN ./. 
Beyond/IN this/DT indication/NN of/IN extensive/JJ decay/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, the/DT fabric/NN gave/VBD little/JJ token/NN of/IN instability/NN ./. 
Perhaps/RB the/DT eye/NN of/IN a/DT scrutinizing/VBG observer/NN might/MD have/VB discovered/VBN a/DT barely/RB perceptible/JJ fissure/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, extending/VBG from/IN the/DT roof/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN in/IN front/NN ,/, made/VBD its/PRP$ way/NN down/IN the/DT wall/NN in/IN a/DT zigzag/JJ direction/NN ,/, until/IN it/PRP became/VBD lost/VBN in/IN the/DT sullen/JJ waters/NNS of/IN the/DT tarn/NN ./. 
Noticing/VBG these/DT things/NNS ,/, I/PRP rode/VBP over/IN a/DT short/JJ causeway/NN to/TO the/DT house/NN ./. 
A/DT servant/NN in/IN waiting/VBG took/VBD my/PRP$ horse/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP entered/VBD the/DT Gothic/NNP archway/NN of/IN the/DT hall/NN ./. 
A/DT valet/NN ,/, of/IN stealthy/JJ step/NN ,/, thence/NN conducted/VBD me/PRP ,/, in/IN silence/NN ,/, through/IN many/JJ dark/NN and/CC intricate/JJ passages/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ progress/NN to/TO the/DT studio/NN of/IN his/PRP$ master/NN ./. 
Much/JJ that/IN I/PRP encountered/VBD on/IN the/DT way/NN contributed/VBD ,/, I/PRP know/VBP not/RB how/WRB ,/, to/TO heighten/VB the/DT vague/JJ sentiments/NNS of/IN which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP already/RB spoken/VBN ./. 
While/IN the/DT objects/NNS around/IN me—while/IN the/DT carvings/NNS of/IN the/DT ceilings/NNS ,/, the/DT sombre/JJ tapestries/NNS of/IN the/DT walls/NNS ,/, the/DT ebon/NN blackness/NN of/IN the/DT floors/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT phantasmagoric/JJ armorial/NN trophies/NNS which/WDT rattled/VBD as/IN I/PRP strode/VBP ,/, were/VBD but/CC matters/NNS to/TO which/WDT ,/, or/CC to/TO such/JJ as/IN which/WDT ,/, I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN accustomed/VBN from/IN my/PRP$ infancy—while/NN I/PRP hesitated/VBD not/RB to/TO acknowledge/VB how/WRB familiar/JJ was/VBD all/DT this—I/NN still/RB wondered/VBD to/TO find/VB how/WRB unfamiliar/JJ were/VBD the/DT fancies/NNS which/WDT ordinary/JJ images/NNS were/VBD stirring/VBG up/RP ./. 
On/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT staircases/NNS I/PRP met/VBD the/DT physician/NN of/IN the/DT family/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ countenance/NN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD ,/, wore/VBD a/DT mingled/JJ expression/NN of/IN low/JJ cunning/NN and/CC perplexity/NN ./. 
He/PRP accosted/VBD me/PRP with/IN trepidation/NN and/CC passed/VBN on/IN ./. 
The/DT valet/NN now/RB threw/VBZ open/RP a/DT door/NN and/CC ushered/JJ me/PRP into/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN his/PRP$ master/NN ./. 
The/DT room/NN in/IN which/WDT I/PRP found/VBD myself/PRP was/VBD very/RB large/JJ and/CC lofty/JJ ./. 
The/DT windows/NNS were/VBD long/RB ,/, narrow/JJ ,/, and/CC pointed/VBD ,/, and/CC at/IN so/RB vast/JJ a/DT distance/NN from/IN the/DT black/JJ oaken/JJ floor/NN as/IN to/TO be/VB altogether/RB inaccessible/JJ from/IN within/IN ./. 
Feeble/JJ gleams/NNS of/IN encrimsoned/JJ light/NN made/VBD their/PRP$ way/NN through/IN the/DT trellised/JJ panes/NNS ,/, and/CC served/VBD to/TO render/VB sufficiently/RB distinct/VBZ the/DT more/RBR prominent/JJ objects/NNS around/IN ;/: the/DT eye/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, struggled/VBN in/IN vain/NN to/TO reach/VB the/DT remoter/NN angles/NNS of/IN the/DT chamber/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT recesses/NNS of/IN the/DT vaulted/JJ and/CC fretted/VBD ceiling/NN ./. 
Dark/NNP draperies/NNS hung/VBD upon/IN the/DT walls/NNS ./. 
The/DT general/JJ furniture/NN was/VBD profuse/RB ,/, comfortless/NN ,/, antique/NN ,/, and/CC tattered/VBD ./. 
Many/JJ books/NNS and/CC musical/JJ instruments/NNS lay/VBD scattered/VBN about/IN ,/, but/CC failed/VBD to/TO give/VB any/DT vitality/NN to/TO the/DT scene/NN ./. 
I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN I/PRP breathed/VBD an/DT atmosphere/NN of/IN sorrow/NN ./. 
An/DT air/NN of/IN stern/JJ ,/, deep/JJ ,/, and/CC irredeemable/JJ gloom/NN hung/NN over/IN and/CC pervaded/VBD all/DT ./. 
Upon/IN my/PRP$ entrance/NN ,/, Usher/NNP arose/VBD from/IN a/DT sofa/NN on/IN which/WDT he/PRP had/VBD been/VBN lying/VBG at/IN full/JJ length/NN ,/, and/CC greeted/VBD me/PRP with/IN ,/, a/DT vivacious/JJ warmth/NN which/WDT had/VBD much/RB in/IN it/PRP ,/, I/PRP at/IN first/JJ thought/NN ,/, of/IN an/DT overdone/NN cordiality—of/VBD the/DT constrained/JJ effort/NN of/IN the/DT ennuyé/JJ man/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN ./. 
A/DT glance/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, at/IN his/PRP$ countenance/NN convinced/VBD me/PRP of/IN his/PRP$ perfect/JJ sincerity/NN ./.

In/IN the/DT manner/NN of/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN I/PRP was/VBD at/IN once/RB struck/VBN with/IN an/DT incoherence—an/JJ inconsistency/NN ;/: and/CC I/PRP soon/RB found/VBD this/DT to/TO arise/VB from/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN feeble/JJ and/CC futile/JJ struggles/NNS to/TO overcome/VB an/DT habitual/JJ trepidancy/NN ,/, an/DT excessive/JJ nervous/JJ agitation/NN ./. 
For/IN something/NN of/IN this/DT nature/NN I/PRP had/VBD indeed/RB been/VBN prepared/VBN ,/, no/DT less/NN by/IN his/PRP$ letter/NN than/IN by/IN reminiscences/NNS of/IN certain/JJ boyish/JJ traits/NNS ,/, and/CC by/IN conclusions/NNS deduced/VBN from/IN his/PRP$ peculiar/JJ physical/JJ conformation/NN and/CC temperament/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD necessary/JJ that/IN some/DT immediate/JJ exertion/NN be/VB made/VBN ;/: yet/CC the/DT turret/NN was/VBD altogether/RB apart/RB from/IN the/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT abbey/NN tenanted/VBN by/IN the/DT servants/NNS —/VBP there/EX were/VBD none/NN within/IN call/NN —/NN I/PRP had/VBD no/DT means/NNS of/IN summoning/VBG them/PRP to/TO my/PRP$ aid/NN without/IN leaving/VBG the/DT room/NN for/IN many/JJ minutes/NNS —/VBP and/CC this/DT I/PRP could/MD not/RB venture/NN to/TO do/VB ./. 
I/PRP therefore/RB struggled/VBD alone/RB in/IN my/PRP$ endeavors/NNS to/TO call/VB back/RB the/DT spirit/NN still/RB hovering/VBG ./. 
In/IN a/DT short/JJ period/NN it/PRP was/VBD certain/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN a/DT relapse/NN had/VBD taken/VBN place/NN ;/: the/DT color/NN disappeared/VBD from/IN both/DT eyelid/JJ and/CC cheek/JJ ,/, leaving/VBG a/DT wanness/NN even/RB more/RBR than/IN that/DT of/IN marble/NN ;/: the/DT lips/NNS became/VBD doubly/RB shrivelled/VBN and/CC pinched/VBN up/RP in/IN the/DT ghastly/JJ expression/NN of/IN death/NN ;/: a/DT repulsive/JJ clamminess/NN and/CC coldness/NN overspread/VBP rapidly/RB the/DT surface/NN of/IN the/DT body/NN ;/: and/CC all/PDT the/DT usual/JJ rigorous/JJ stiffness/NN immediately/RB supervened/VBD ./. 
I/PRP fell/VBD back/RB with/IN a/DT shudder/NN upon/IN the/DT couch/NN from/IN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN so/RB startlingly/RB aroused/VBN ,/, and/CC again/RB gave/VBD myself/PRP up/RP to/TO passionate/VB waking/JJ visions/NNS of/IN Ligeia/NNP ./. 
An/DT hour/NN thus/RB elapsed/VBD when/WRB (/( could/MD it/PRP be/VB possible/JJ ?/. )/) 
I/PRP was/VBD a/DT second/JJ time/NN aware/NN of/IN some/DT vague/JJ sound/NN issuing/VBG from/IN the/DT region/NN of/IN the/DT bed/NN ./. 
I/PRP listened/VBD —/NNP in/IN extremity/NN of/IN horror/NN ./. 
The/DT sound/NN came/VBD again/RB —/JJ it/PRP was/VBD a/DT sigh/NN ./. 
Rushing/VBG to/TO the/DT corpse/NN ,/, I/PRP saw/VBD —/NNP distinctly/RB saw/VBD —/PRP a/DT tremor/NN upon/IN the/DT lips/NNS ./. 
In/IN a/DT minute/NN afterward/IN they/PRP relaxed/VBP ,/, disclosing/VBG a/DT bright/JJ line/NN of/IN the/DT pearly/JJ teeth/NN ./. 
Amazement/NN now/RB struggled/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ bosom/NN with/IN the/DT profound/NN awe/NN which/WDT had/VBD hitherto/NN reigned/VBN there/RB alone/RB ./. 
I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN my/PRP$ vision/NN grew/VBD dim/NN ,/, that/IN my/PRP$ reason/NN wandered/VBD ;/: and/CC it/PRP was/VBD only/RB by/IN a/DT violent/JJ effort/NN that/IN I/PRP at/IN length/NN succeeded/VBN in/IN nerving/VBG myself/PRP to/TO the/DT task/NN which/WDT duty/NN thus/RB once/RB more/JJR had/VBD pointed/VBN out/RP ./. 
There/EX was/VBD now/RB a/DT partial/JJ glow/NN upon/IN the/DT forehead/NN and/CC upon/IN the/DT cheek/NN and/CC throat/NN ;/: a/DT perceptible/JJ warmth/NN pervaded/VBD the/DT whole/JJ frame/NN ;/: there/EX was/VBD even/RB a/DT slight/JJ pulsation/NN at/IN the/DT heart/NN ./. 
The/DT lady/NN lived/VBD ;/: and/CC with/IN redoubled/JJ ardor/NN I/PRP betook/VBP myself/PRP to/TO the/DT task/NN of/IN restoration/NN ./. 
I/PRP chafed/VBP and/CC bathed/VBD the/DT temples/NNS and/CC the/DT hands/NNS ,/, and/CC used/VBD every/DT exertion/NN which/WDT experience/NN ,/, and/CC no/DT little/JJ medical/JJ reading/NN ,/, could/MD suggest/VB ./. 
But/CC in/IN vain/NN ./. 
Suddenly/RB ,/, the/DT color/NN fled/VBD ,/, the/DT pulsation/NN ceased/VBD ,/, the/DT lips/NNS resumed/VBD the/DT expression/NN of/IN the/DT dead/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, in/IN an/DT instant/JJ afterward/NN ,/, the/DT whole/JJ body/NN took/VBD upon/IN itself/PRP the/DT icy/NN chilliness/NN ,/, the/DT livid/NN hue/NN ,/, the/DT intense/JJ rigidity/NN ,/, the/DT sunken/JJ outline/NN ,/, and/CC all/PDT the/DT loathsome/JJ peculiarities/NNS of/IN that/DT which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN ,/, for/IN many/JJ days/NNS ,/, a/DT tenant/NN of/IN the/DT tomb/NN ./. 
And/CC again/RB I/PRP sunk/VBP into/IN visions/NNS of/IN Ligeia/NNP —/NNP and/CC again/RB ,/, (/( what/WP marvel/VBP that/IN I/PRP shudder/VBP while/IN I/PRP write/VBP ?/. )/) 
again/RB there/EX reached/VBN my/PRP$ ears/NNS a/DT low/JJ sob/NN from/IN the/DT region/NN of/IN the/DT ebony/NN bed/NN ./. 
But/CC why/WRB shall/MD I/PRP minutely/RB detail/VBP the/DT unspeakable/JJ horrors/NNS of/IN that/DT night/NN ?/. 
Why/WRB shall/MD I/PRP pause/VBP to/TO relate/VB how/WRB ,/, time/NN after/IN time/NN ,/, until/IN near/IN the/DT period/NN of/IN the/DT gray/JJ dawn/NN ,/, this/DT hideous/JJ drama/NN of/IN revivification/NN [/NNP [/NNP revivification/NN ]/NNP ]/NNP was/VBD repeated/VBN ;/: how/WRB each/DT terrific/NN relapse/NN was/VBD only/RB into/IN a/DT sterner/NN and/CC apparently/RB more/RBR irredeemable/JJ death/NN ;/: how/WRB each/DT agony/NN wore/VBD the/DT aspect/NN of/IN a/DT struggle/NN with/IN some/DT invisible/JJ foe/NN ;/: and/CC how/WRB each/DT struggle/NN was/VBD succeeded/VBN by/IN I/PRP know/VBP not/RB what/WP of/IN wild/JJ change/NN in/IN the/DT personal/JJ appearance/NN of/IN the/DT corpse/NN ?/. 
Let/VB me/PRP hurry/VB to/TO a/DT conclusion/NN ./. 
The/DT greater/JJR part/NN of/IN the/DT fearful/JJ night/NN had/VBD worn/VBN away/RB ,/, and/CC she/PRP who/WP had/VBD been/VBN dead/JJ ,/, once/RB again/RB stirred/JJ —/NNS and/CC now/RB more/RBR vigorously/RB than/IN hitherto/NN ,/, although/IN arousing/VBG from/IN a/DT dissolution/NN more/RBR appalling/JJ in/IN its/PRP$ utter/NN hopelessness/NN than/IN any/DT ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD long/RB ceased/VBN to/TO struggle/VB or/CC to/TO move/VB ,/, and/CC remained/VBD sitting/VBG rigidly/RB upon/IN the/DT ottoman/NN ,/, a/DT helpless/JJ prey/NN to/TO a/DT whirl/NN of/IN violent/JJ emotions/NNS ,/, of/IN which/WDT extreme/JJ awe/NN was/VBD perhaps/RB the/DT least/JJS terrible/JJ ,/, the/DT least/JJS consuming/NN ./. 
The/DT corpse/NN ,/, I/PRP repeat/VBP ,/, stirred/VBD ,/, and/CC now/RB more/RBR vigorously/RB than/IN before/RB ./. 
The/DT hues/NNS of/IN life/NN flushed/VBN up/RP with/IN unwonted/JJ energy/NN into/IN the/DT countenance/NN —/VBD the/DT limbs/NNS relaxed/VBD —/NNP and/CC ,/, save/VBP that/IN the/DT eyelids/NNS were/VBD yet/RB pressed/VBN heavily/RB together/RB ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT bandages/NNS and/CC draperies/NNS of/IN the/DT grave/NN still/RB imparted/VBD their/PRP$ charnel/NNS character/NN to/TO the/DT figure/NN ,/, I/PRP might/MD have/VB dreamed/VBN that/IN Rowena/NNP had/VBD indeed/RB shaken/VBN off/RP ,/, utterly/RB ,/, the/DT fetters/NNS of/IN Death/NNP ./. 
But/CC if/IN this/DT idea/NN was/VBD not/RB ,/, even/RB then/RB ,/, altogether/RB adopted/VBN ,/, I/PRP could/MD at/IN least/JJS doubt/NN no/DT longer/RB ,/, when/WRB ,/, arising/VBG from/IN the/DT bed/NN ,/, tottering/VBG ,/, with/IN feeble/JJ steps/NNS ,/, with/IN closed/JJ eyes/NNS ,/, and/CC with/IN the/DT manner/NN of/IN one/CD bewildered/VBN in/IN a/DT dream/NN ,/, the/DT thing/NN that/WDT was/VBD enshrouded/VBN advanced/JJ boldly/RB [/VBP [/JJ bodily/RB ]/NNP ]/NNP and/CC palpably/RB into/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT apartment/NN ./. 
I/PRP trembled/VBD not/RB —/JJ I/PRP stirred/VBD not/RB —/NNP for/IN a/DT crowd/NN of/IN unutterable/JJ fancies/NNS connected/VBN with/IN the/DT air/NN ,/, the/DT stature/NN ,/, the/DT demeanor/NN of/IN the/DT figure/NN ,/, rushing/VBG hurriedly/RB through/IN my/PRP$ brain/NN ,/, had/VBD paralyzed/VBN —/NNP had/VBD chilled/VBN me/PRP into/IN stone/NN ./. 
I/PRP stirred/VBD not/RB —/JJ but/CC gazed/JJ upon/IN the/DT apparition/NN ./. 
There/EX was/VBD a/DT mad/JJ disorder/NN in/IN my/PRP$ thoughts/NNS —/VBP a/DT tumult/NN unappeasable/JJ ./. 
Could/MD it/PRP ,/, indeed/RB ,/, be/VB the/DT living/NN Rowena/NNP who/WP confronted/VBD me/PRP ?/.

The/DT bandage/NN lay/VBD heavily/RB about/IN the/DT mouth/NN —/NN but/CC then/RB might/MD it/PRP not/RB be/VB the/DT mouth/NN of/IN the/DT breathing/VBG Lady/NNP of/IN Tremaine/NNP ?/.

One/CD bound/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP had/VBD reached/VBN her/PRP$ feet/NNS !/.
