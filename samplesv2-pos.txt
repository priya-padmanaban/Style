And/CC a/DT ton/NN of/IN gold/NN was/VBD dragged/VBN in/IN by/IN sixteen/JJ strong/JJ men/NNS ,/, but/CC he/PRP put/VBD it/PRP all/DT into/IN the/DT sack/NN with/IN one/CD hand/NN ,/, saying/VBG ,/, ''/'' Why/WRB do/VBP n't/RB you/PRP bring/VB some/DT more/JJR ?/.

``/`` I/PRP will/MD not/RB look/VB too/RB closely/RB ,/, ''/'' said/VBD he/PRP ,/, ``/`` but/CC take/VB what/WP I/PRP can/MD get/VB ,/, so/RB long/RB as/IN the/DT sack/NN is/VBZ full/JJ ./. ''/'' 
And/CC when/WRB all/DT was/VBD put/VBN in/IN there/EX was/VBD still/RB plenty/JJ of/IN room/NN ./. 
``/`` I/PRP must/MD make/VB an/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ;/: ``/`` if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB full/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB much/JJ the/DT easier/JJR to/TO tie/VB up/RP ./. ''/'' 
And/CC he/PRP hoisted/VBD it/PRP on/IN his/PRP$ back/NN ,/, and/CC went/VBD off/RP with/IN his/PRP$ comrades/NNS ./. 
When/WRB the/DT king/NN saw/VBD all/PDT the/DT wealth/NN of/IN his/PRP$ realm/NN carried/VBD off/RP by/IN a/DT single/JJ man/NN he/PRP was/VBD full/JJ of/IN wrath/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP bade/VBD his/PRP$ cavalry/NN mount/NN ,/, and/CC follow/VBP after/IN the/DT six/CD men/NNS ,/, and/CC take/VB the/DT sack/NN away/RB from/IN the/DT strong/JJ man/NN ./. 
Two/CD regiments/NNS were/VBD soon/RB up/RB to/TO them/PRP ,/, and/CC called/VBD them/PRP to/TO consider/VB themselves/PRP prisoners/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO deliver/VB up/RP the/DT sack/NN ,/, or/CC be/VB cut/VBN in/IN pieces/NNS ./. 
``/`` Prisoners/NNS ,/, say/VBP you/PRP ?/. ''/''

Here/RB was/VBD once/RB a/DT cook/NN called/VBN Grethel/NNP ,/, who/WP wore/VBD shoes/NNS with/IN red/JJ heels/NNS ,/, and/CC when/WRB she/PRP went/VBD out/RP in/IN them/PRP she/PRP gave/VBD herself/PRP great/JJ airs/NNS ,/, and/CC thought/VBD herself/PRP very/RB fine/JJ indeed/RB ./.

``/`` If/IN he/PRP does/VBZ not/RB make/VB haste/NN ,/, ''/'' cried/VBD Grethel/NNP to/TO her/PRP$ master/NN ,/, ``/`` I/PRP must/MD take/VB them/PRP away/RB from/IN the/DT fire/NN ;/: it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT pity/NN and/CC a/DT shame/NN not/RB to/TO eat/VB them/PRP now/RB ,/, just/RB when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP done/VBN to/TO a/DT turn/NN ./. ''/'' 
And/CC the/DT master/NN said/VBD he/PRP would/MD run/VB himself/PRP and/CC fetch/VB the/DT guest/NN ./. 
As/RB soon/RB as/IN he/PRP had/VBD turned/VBN his/PRP$ back/NN ,/, Grethel/NNP took/VBD the/DT fowls/NN from/IN before/IN the/DT fire/NN ./. 
``/`` Standing/VBG so/RB long/RB before/IN the/DT fire/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD she/PRP ,/, ``/`` makes/VBZ one/CD hot/JJ and/CC thirsty/JJ ,/, —and/VB who/WP knows/VBZ when/WRB they/PRP will/MD come/VB !/.

And/CC now/RB they/PRP began/VBD to/TO smell/VB so/RB good/JJ that/IN Grethel/NNP saying/VBG ,/, ``/`` I/PRP must/MD find/VB out/RP whether/IN they/PRP really/RB are/VBP all/DT right/JJ ,/, ''/'' licked/VBD her/PRP$ fingers/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB cried/VBD ,/, ``/`` Well/UH ,/, I/PRP never/RB !/.

So/IN she/PRP ran/VBD to/TO the/DT window/NN to/TO see/VB if/IN her/PRP$ master/NN and/CC his/PRP$ guest/JJS were/VBD coming/VBG ,/, but/CC as/IN she/PRP could/MD see/VB nobody/NN she/PRP went/VBD back/RB to/TO her/PRP$ fowls/NN ./. 
``/`` Why/WRB ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT wings/NNS is/VBZ burning/VBG !/. ''/''

It/PRP told/VBD of/IN a/DT certain/JJ ancient/JJ man/NN who/WP had/VBD once/RB dwelt/VBN on/IN our/PRP$ estates/NNS ,/, a/DT person/NN of/IN no/DT small/JJ accomplishments/NNS ,/, though/RB little/JJ above/IN the/DT rank/NN of/IN peasant/NN ;/: by/IN name/NN ,/, Michel/NNP ,/, usually/RB designated/VBN by/IN the/DT surname/NN of/IN Mauvais/NNP ,/, the/DT Evil/NNP ,/, on/IN account/NN of/IN his/PRP$ sinister/NN reputation/NN ./. 
He/PRP had/VBD studied/VBN beyond/IN the/DT custom/NN of/IN his/PRP$ kind/NN ,/, seeking/VBG such/JJ things/NNS as/IN the/DT Philosopher/NNP 's/POS Stone/NNP ,/, or/CC the/DT Elixir/NNP of/IN Eternal/NNP Life/NNP ,/, and/CC was/VBD reputed/VBN wise/NN in/IN the/DT terrible/JJ secrets/NNS of/IN Black/NNP Magic/NNP and/CC Alchemy/NNP ./. 
Michel/NNP Mauvais/NNP had/VBD one/CD son/NN ,/, named/VBN Charles/NNP ,/, a/DT youth/NN as/RB proficient/JJ as/IN himself/PRP in/IN the/DT hidden/JJ arts/NNS ,/, and/CC who/WP had/VBD therefore/RB been/VBN called/VBN Le/NNP Sorcier/NNP ,/, or/CC the/DT Wizard/NNP ./. 
This/DT pair/NN ,/, shunned/VBN by/IN all/DT honest/JJS folk/NN ,/, were/VBD suspected/VBN of/IN the/DT most/RBS hideous/JJ practices/NNS ./. 
Old/NNP Michel/NNP was/VBD said/VBD to/TO have/VB burnt/VBN his/PRP$ wife/NN alive/JJ as/IN a/DT sacrifice/NN to/TO the/DT Devil/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT unaccountable/JJ disappearances/NNS of/IN many/JJ small/JJ peasant/JJ children/NNS were/VBD laid/VBN at/IN the/DT dreaded/JJ door/NN of/IN these/DT two/CD ./. 
Yet/CC through/IN the/DT dark/JJ natures/NNS of/IN the/DT father/NN and/CC the/DT son/NN ran/VBD one/CD redeeming/VBG ray/NN of/IN humanity/NN ;/: the/DT evil/JJ old/JJ man/NN loved/VBD his/PRP$ offspring/VBG with/IN fierce/JJ intensity/NN ,/, whilst/VBP the/DT youth/NN had/VBD for/IN his/PRP$ parent/NN a/DT more/JJR than/IN filial/JJ affection/NN ./. 
One/CD night/NN the/DT castle/NN on/IN the/DT hill/NN was/VBD thrown/VBN into/IN the/DT wildest/JJS confusion/NN by/IN the/DT vanishment/NN of/IN young/JJ Godfrey/NNP ,/, son/NN to/TO Henri/NNP ,/, the/DT Comte/NNP ./. 
A/DT searching/VBG party/NN ,/, headed/VBN by/IN the/DT frantic/JJ father/NN ,/, invaded/VBD the/DT cottage/NN of/IN the/DT sorcerers/NNS and/CC there/EX came/VBD upon/IN old/JJ Michel/NNP Mauvais/NNP ,/, busy/JJ over/IN a/DT huge/JJ and/CC violently/RB boiling/VBG cauldron/NN ./. 
Without/IN certain/JJ cause/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT ungoverned/JJ madness/NN of/IN fury/NN and/CC despair/NN ,/, the/DT Comte/NNP laid/VBD hands/NNS on/IN the/DT aged/VBN wizard/NN ,/, and/CC here/RB he/PRP released/VBD his/PRP$ murderous/JJ hold/VB his/PRP$ victim/NN was/VBD no/DT more/RBR ./. 
Meanwhile/RB joyful/JJ servants/NNS were/VBD proclaiming/VBG aloud/IN the/DT finding/NN of/IN young/JJ Godfrey/NNP in/IN a/DT distant/JJ and/CC unused/JJ chamber/NN of/IN the/DT great/JJ edifice/NN ,/, telling/VBG too/RB late/JJ that/IN poor/JJ Michel/NNP had/VBD been/VBN killed/VBN in/IN vain/NN ./. 
As/IN the/DT Comte/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ associates/NNS turned/VBD away/RB from/IN the/DT lowly/JJ abode/NN of/IN the/DT alchemists/NNS ,/, the/DT form/NN of/IN Charles/NNP Le/NNP Sorcier/NNP appeared/VBD through/IN the/DT trees/NNS ./. 
The/DT excited/JJ chatter/NN of/IN the/DT menials/NNS standing/VBG about/IN told/VBD him/PRP what/WP had/VBD occurred/VBN ,/, yet/RB he/PRP seemed/VBD at/IN first/JJ unmoved/JJ at/IN his/PRP$ father/NN 's/POS fate/NN ./. 
Then/RB ,/, slowly/RB advancing/VBG to/TO meet/VB the/DT Comte/NNP ,/, he/PRP pronounced/VBD in/IN dull/NN yet/RB terrible/JJ accents/NNS the/DT curse/NN that/IN ever/RB afterward/RB haunted/VBD the/DT house/NN of/IN C——/NNP ./. 
``/`` May/NNP ne'er/VB a/DT noble/JJ of/IN thy/JJ murderous/JJ line/NN Survive/NNP to/TO reach/VB a/DT greater/JJR age/NN than/IN thine/NN !/. ''/''

The/DT Comte/NNP died/VBD without/IN utterance/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD buried/VBN the/DT next/JJ day/NN ,/, but/CC little/RB more/JJR than/IN two/CD and/CC thirty/JJ years/NNS from/IN the/DT hour/NN of/IN his/PRP$ birth/NN ./. 
No/DT trace/NN of/IN the/DT assassin/NN could/MD be/VB found/VBN ,/, though/IN relentless/JJ bands/NNS of/IN peasants/NNS scoured/VBD the/DT neighboring/JJ woods/NNS and/CC the/DT meadow-land/NN around/IN the/DT hill/NN ./. 
Thus/RB time/NN and/CC the/DT want/NN of/IN a/DT reminder/NN dulled/VBD the/DT memory/NN of/IN the/DT curse/NN in/IN the/DT minds/NNS of/IN the/DT late/JJ Comte/NNP 's/POS family/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN when/WRB Godfrey/NNP ,/, innocent/JJ cause/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ tragedy/NN and/CC now/RB bearing/VBG the/DT title/NN ,/, was/VBD killed/VBN by/IN an/DT arrow/NN whilst/NN hunting/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN thirty-two/NN ,/, there/EX were/VBD no/DT thoughts/NNS save/VBP those/DT of/IN grief/NN at/IN his/PRP$ demise/NN ./. 
But/CC when/WRB ,/, years/NNS afterward/RB ,/, the/DT next/JJ young/JJ Comte/NNP ,/, Robert/NNP by/IN name/NN ,/, was/VBD found/VBN dead/JJ in/IN a/DT nearby/JJ field/NN from/IN no/DT apparent/JJ cause/NN ,/, the/DT peasants/NNS told/VBD in/IN whispers/NNS that/IN their/PRP$ seigneur/NN had/VBD but/CC lately/RB passed/VBD his/PRP$ thirty-second/NN birthday/NN when/WRB surprised/VBN by/IN early/JJ death/NN ./. 
Louis/NNP ,/, son/NN to/TO Robert/NNP ,/, was/VBD found/VBN drowned/VBN in/IN the/DT moat/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ fateful/JJ age/NN ,/, and/CC thus/RB down/RB through/IN the/DT centuries/NNS ran/VBD the/DT ominous/JJ chronicle/NN ;/: Henris/NNP ,/, Roberts/NNP ,/, Antoines/NNP ,/, and/CC Armands/NNP snatched/VBD from/IN happy/JJ and/CC virtuous/JJ lives/NNS when/WRB a/DT little/RB below/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN their/PRP$ unfortunate/JJ ancestor/NN at/IN his/PRP$ murder/NN ./. 
That/DT I/PRP had/VBD left/VBN at/IN most/JJS but/CC eleven/JJ years/NNS of/IN further/JJ existence/NN was/VBD made/VBN certain/JJ to/TO me/PRP by/IN the/DT words/NNS which/WDT I/PRP read/VBP ./. 
My/PRP$ life/NN ,/, previously/RB held/VBN at/IN small/JJ value/NN ,/, now/RB became/VBD dearer/NN to/TO me/PRP each/DT day/NN ,/, as/IN I/PRP delved/VBD deeper/NN and/CC deeper/NN into/IN the/DT mysteries/NNS of/IN the/DT hidden/JJ world/NN of/IN black/JJ magic/NN ./. 
Isolated/VBN as/IN I/PRP was/VBD ,/, modern/JJ science/NN had/VBD produced/VBN no/DT impression/NN upon/IN me/PRP ,/, and/CC I/PRP labored/VBD as/IN in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP Ages/NNP ,/, as/RB wrapt/NN as/IN had/VBD been/VBN old/JJ Michel/NNP and/CC young/JJ Charles/NNP themselves/PRP in/IN the/DT acquisition/NN of/IN demonological/JJ and/CC alchemical/JJ learning/NN ./. 
Yet/RB read/VBN as/IN I/PRP might/MD ,/, in/IN no/DT manner/NN could/MD I/PRP account/VBP for/IN the/DT strange/JJ curse/NN upon/IN my/PRP$ line/NN ./. 
In/IN unusually/RB rational/JJ moments/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD even/RB go/VB so/RB far/RB as/IN to/TO seek/VB a/DT natural/JJ explanation/NN ,/, attributing/VBG the/DT early/JJ deaths/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ ancestors/NNS to/TO the/DT sinister/NN Charles/NNP Le/NNP Sorcier/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ heirs/NN ;/: yet/CC having/VBG found/VBN upon/IN careful/JJ inquiry/NN that/IN there/EX were/VBD no/DT known/JJ descendants/NNS of/IN the/DT alchemist/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD fall/VB back/RB to/TO my/PRP$ occult/NN studies/NNS ,/, and/CC once/RB more/JJR endeavor/NN to/TO find/VB a/DT spell/NN that/WDT would/MD release/VB my/PRP$ house/NN from/IN its/PRP$ terrible/JJ burden/NN ./. 
Upon/IN one/CD thing/NN I/PRP was/VBD absolutely/RB resolved/VBN ./. 
I/PRP should/MD never/RB wed/VB ,/, for/IN since/IN no/DT other/JJ branches/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ family/NN were/VBD in/IN existence/NN ,/, I/PRP might/MD thus/RB end/VB the/DT curse/NN with/IN myself/PRP ./. 
As/IN I/PRP drew/VBD near/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN thirty/NN ,/, old/JJ Pierre/NNP was/VBD called/VBN to/TO the/DT land/NN beyond/IN ./. 
Alone/RB I/PRP buried/VBD him/PRP beneath/VB the/DT stones/NNS of/IN the/DT courtyard/NN about/IN which/WDT he/PRP had/VBD loved/VBN to/TO wander/VB in/IN life/NN ./. 
Thus/RB was/VBD I/PRP left/VBD to/TO ponder/VB on/IN myself/PRP as/IN the/DT only/JJ human/JJ creature/NN within/IN the/DT great/JJ fortress/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN my/PRP$ utter/JJ solitude/NN my/PRP$ mind/NN began/VBD to/TO cease/VB its/PRP$ vain/NN protest/NN against/IN the/DT impending/JJ doom/NN ,/, to/TO become/VB almost/RB reconciled/VBN to/TO the/DT fate/NN which/WDT so/RB many/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ ancestors/NNS had/VBD met/VBN ./. 
Much/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ time/NN was/VBD now/RB occupied/VBN in/IN the/DT exploration/NN of/IN the/DT ruined/VBN and/CC abandoned/VBN halls/NNS and/CC towers/NNS of/IN the/DT old/JJ chateau/NN ,/, which/WDT in/IN youth/NN fear/NN had/VBD caused/VBN me/PRP to/TO shun/VB ,/, and/CC some/DT of/IN which/WDT old/JJ Pierre/NNP had/VBD once/RB told/VBN me/PRP had/VBD not/RB been/VBN trodden/VBN by/IN human/JJ foot/NN for/IN over/IN four/CD centuries/NNS ./. 
Strange/NNP and/CC awesome/VB were/VBD many/JJ of/IN the/DT objects/NNS I/PRP encountered/VBD ./. 
Furniture/NN ,/, covered/VBN by/IN the/DT dust/NN of/IN ages/NNS and/CC crumbling/VBG with/IN the/DT rot/NN of/IN long/JJ dampness/NN met/VBD my/PRP$ eyes/NNS ./. 
Cobwebs/NNP in/IN a/DT profusion/NN never/RB before/RB seen/VBN by/IN me/PRP were/VBD spun/VBN everywhere/RB ,/, and/CC huge/JJ bats/NNS flapped/VBD their/PRP$ bony/NN and/CC uncanny/JJ wings/NNS on/IN all/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT otherwise/RB untenanted/JJ gloom/NN ./. 
Of/IN my/PRP$ exact/JJ age/NN ,/, even/RB down/RP to/TO days/NNS and/CC hours/NNS ,/, I/PRP kept/VBD a/DT most/RBS careful/JJ record/NN ,/, for/IN each/DT movement/NN of/IN the/DT pendulum/NN of/IN the/DT massive/JJ clock/NN in/IN the/DT library/NN tolled/VBD off/RP so/RB much/RB more/JJR of/IN my/PRP$ doomed/JJ existence/NN ./. 
At/IN length/NN I/PRP approached/VBD that/IN time/NN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD so/RB long/JJ viewed/NN with/IN apprehension/NN ./. 
Since/IN most/JJS of/IN my/PRP$ ancestors/NNS had/VBD been/VBN seized/VBN some/DT little/JJ while/IN before/IN they/PRP reached/VBD the/DT exact/JJ age/NN of/IN the/DT Comte/NNP Henri/NNP at/IN his/PRP$ end/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD every/DT moment/NN on/IN the/DT watch/NN for/IN the/DT coming/VBG of/IN the/DT unknown/JJ death/NN ./. 
In/IN what/WP strange/JJ form/VBP the/DT curse/NN should/MD overtake/VB me/PRP ,/, I/PRP knew/VBD not/RB ;/: but/CC I/PRP was/VBD resolved/VBN at/IN least/JJS that/IN it/PRP should/MD not/RB find/VB me/PRP a/DT cowardly/RB or/CC a/DT passive/JJ victim/NN ./. 
With/IN new/JJ vigour/NN I/PRP applied/VBD myself/PRP to/TO my/PRP$ examination/NN of/IN the/DT old/JJ chateau/NN and/CC its/PRP$ contents/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD upon/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT longest/JJS of/IN all/DT my/PRP$ excursions/NNS of/IN discovery/NN in/IN the/DT deserted/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT castle/NN ,/, less/JJR than/IN a/DT week/NN before/IN that/DT fatal/JJ hour/NN which/WDT I/PRP felt/VBD must/MD mark/VB the/DT utmost/JJ limit/NN of/IN my/PRP$ stay/NN on/IN earth/NN ,/, beyond/IN which/WDT I/PRP could/MD have/VB not/RB even/RB the/DT slightest/JJS hope/NN of/IN continuing/VBG to/TO draw/VB breath/NN ,/, that/IN I/PRP came/VBD upon/IN the/DT culminating/VBG event/NN of/IN my/PRP$ whole/JJ life/NN ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD spent/VBN the/DT better/JJR part/NN of/IN the/DT morning/NN in/IN climbing/VBG up/RP and/CC down/IN half/NN ruined/JJ staircases/NNS in/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS dilapidated/JJ of/IN the/DT ancient/JJ turrets/NNS ./. 
As/IN the/DT afternoon/NN progressed/VBD ,/, I/PRP sought/VBD the/DT lower/JJR levels/NNS ,/, descending/VBG into/IN what/WP appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB either/RB a/DT mediaeval/JJ place/NN of/IN confinement/NN ,/, or/CC a/DT more/RBR recently/RB excavated/VBN storehouse/NN for/IN gunpowder/NN ./. 
As/IN I/PRP slowly/VBP traversed/VBD the/DT nitre-encrusted/JJ passageway/NN at/IN the/DT foot/NN of/IN the/DT last/JJ staircase/NN ,/, the/DT paving/NN became/VBD very/RB damp/JJ ,/, and/CC soon/RB I/PRP saw/VBD by/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN my/PRP$ flickering/NN torch/NN that/IN a/DT blank/NN ,/, water-stained/JJ wall/NN impeded/VBD my/PRP$ journey/NN ./. 
Turning/VBG to/TO retrace/VB my/PRP$ steps/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ eye/NN fell/VBD upon/IN a/DT small/JJ trap-door/NN with/IN a/DT ring/NN ,/, which/WDT lay/VBD directly/RB beneath/IN my/PRP$ feet/NNS ./. 
Pausing/VBG ,/, I/PRP succeeded/VBD with/IN difficulty/NN in/IN raising/VBG it/PRP ,/, whereupon/IN there/EX was/VBD revealed/VBN a/DT black/JJ aperture/NN ,/, exhaling/VBG noxious/JJ fumes/NNS which/WDT caused/VBD my/PRP$ torch/NN to/TO sputter/VB ,/, and/CC disclosing/VBG in/IN the/DT unsteady/JJ glare/NN the/DT top/NN of/IN a/DT flight/NN of/IN stone/NN steps/NNS ./. 
As/RB soon/RB as/IN the/DT torch/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP lowered/VBD into/IN the/DT repellent/JJ depths/NNS ,/, burned/VBD freely/RB and/CC steadily/RB ,/, I/PRP commenced/VBD my/PRP$ descent/NN ./. 
The/DT steps/NNS were/VBD many/JJ ,/, and/CC led/VBD to/TO a/DT narrow/JJ stone-flagged/JJ passage/NN which/WDT I/PRP knew/VBD must/MD be/VB far/RB underground/JJ ./. 
This/DT passage/NN proved/VBD of/IN great/JJ length/NN ,/, and/CC terminated/VBN in/IN a/DT massive/JJ oaken/NN door/NN ,/, dripping/VBG with/IN the/DT moisture/NN of/IN the/DT place/NN ,/, and/CC stoutly/RB resisting/VBG all/DT my/PRP$ attempts/NNS to/TO open/VB it/PRP ./. 
Ceasing/VBG after/IN a/DT time/NN my/PRP$ efforts/NNS in/IN this/DT direction/NN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD proceeded/VBN back/RB some/DT distance/NN toward/IN the/DT steps/NNS ,/, when/WRB there/EX suddenly/RB fell/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ experience/NN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS profound/JJ and/CC maddening/VBG shocks/NNS capable/JJ of/IN reception/NN by/IN the/DT human/JJ mind/NN ./. 
Without/IN warning/VBG ,/, I/PRP heard/VBD the/DT heavy/JJ door/NN behind/IN me/PRP creak/VBP slowly/RB open/JJ upon/IN its/PRP$ rusted/JJ hinges/NNS ./. 
My/PRP$ immediate/JJ sensations/NNS are/VBP incapable/JJ of/IN analysis/NN ./. 
To/TO be/VB confronted/VBN in/IN a/DT place/NN as/IN thoroughly/RB deserted/VBN as/IN I/PRP had/VBD deemed/VBN the/DT old/JJ castle/NN with/IN evidence/NN of/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN man/NN or/CC spirit/NN ,/, produced/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ brain/NN a/DT horror/NN of/IN the/DT most/RBS acute/JJ description/NN ./. 
When/WRB at/IN last/JJ I/PRP turned/VBD and/CC faced/VBD the/DT seat/NN of/IN the/DT sound/NN ,/, my/PRP$ eyes/NNS must/MD have/VB started/VBN from/IN their/PRP$ orbits/NNS at/IN the/DT sight/NN that/IN they/PRP beheld/VBP ./. 
There/EX in/IN the/DT ancient/JJ Gothic/NNP doorway/NN stood/VBD a/DT human/JJ figure/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD that/IN of/IN a/DT man/NN clad/NN in/IN a/DT skull-cap/JJ and/CC long/JJ mediaeval/NN tunic/NN of/IN dark/JJ colour/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ long/JJ hair/NN and/CC flowing/VBG beard/NN were/VBD of/IN a/DT terrible/JJ and/CC intense/JJ black/JJ hue/NN ,/, and/CC of/IN incredible/JJ profusion/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ forehead/NN ,/, high/JJ beyond/IN the/DT usual/JJ dimensions/NNS ;/: his/PRP$ cheeks/NN ,/, deep/JJ sunken/NN and/CC heavily/RB lined/VBN with/IN wrinkles/NNS ;/: and/CC his/PRP$ hands/NNS ,/, long/RB ,/, claw-like/JJ and/CC gnarled/JJ ,/, were/VBD of/IN such/JJ a/DT deathly/JJ ,/, marble-like/JJ whiteness/NN as/IN I/PRP have/VBP never/RB elsewhere/RB seen/VBN in/IN man/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ figure/NN ,/, lean/NN to/TO the/DT proportions/NNS of/IN a/DT skeleton/NN ,/, was/VBD strangely/RB bent/JJ and/CC almost/RB lost/VBN within/IN the/DT voluminous/JJ folds/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ peculiar/JJ garment/NN ./. 
But/CC strangest/JJS of/IN all/DT were/VBD his/PRP$ eyes/NNS ;/: twin/VB caves/NNS of/IN abysmal/JJ blackness/NN ;/: profound/NN in/IN expression/NN of/IN understanding/NN ,/, yet/RB inhuman/VBN in/IN degree/NN of/IN wickedness/NN ./. 
These/DT were/VBD now/RB fixed/VBN upon/IN me/PRP ,/, piercing/VBG my/PRP$ soul/NN with/IN their/PRP$ hatred/VBN ,/, and/CC rooting/VBG me/PRP to/TO the/DT spot/NN whereon/NN I/PRP stood/VBD ./. 
At/IN last/JJ the/DT figure/NN spoke/VBD in/IN a/DT rumbling/JJ voice/NN that/WDT chilled/VBD me/PRP through/IN with/IN its/PRP$ dull/NN hollowness/NN and/CC latent/JJ malevolence/NN ./. 
The/DT language/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT discourse/NN was/VBD clothed/VBN was/VBD that/IN debased/JJ form/NN of/IN Latin/NNP in/IN use/NN amongst/IN the/DT more/RBR learned/JJ men/NNS of/IN the/DT Middle/NNP Ages/NNP ,/, and/CC made/VBD familiar/JJ to/TO me/PRP by/IN my/PRP$ prolonged/JJ researches/NNS into/IN the/DT works/NNS of/IN the/DT old/JJ alchemists/NNS and/CC demonologists/NNS ./. 
The/DT apparition/NN spoke/NN of/IN the/DT curse/NN which/WDT had/VBD hovered/VBN over/IN my/PRP$ house/NN ,/, told/VBD me/PRP of/IN my/PRP$ coming/JJ end/NN ,/, dwelt/NN on/IN the/DT wrong/JJ perpetrated/VBN by/IN my/PRP$ ancestor/NN against/IN old/JJ Michel/NNP Mauvais/NNP ,/, and/CC gloated/VBD over/IN the/DT revenge/NN of/IN Charles/NNP Le/NNP Sorcier/NNP ./. 
He/PRP told/VBD me/PRP how/WRB the/DT young/JJ Charles/NNP had/VBD escaped/VBN into/IN the/DT night/NN ,/, returning/VBG in/IN after/IN years/NNS to/TO kill/VB Godfrey/NNP the/DT heir/NN with/IN an/DT arrow/NN just/RB as/IN he/PRP approached/VBD the/DT age/NN which/WDT had/VBD been/VBN his/PRP$ father/NN 's/POS at/IN his/PRP$ assassination/NN ;/: how/WRB he/PRP had/VBD secretly/RB returned/VBN to/TO the/DT estate/NN and/CC established/VBN himself/PRP ,/, unknown/JJ ,/, in/IN the/DT even/RB then/RB deserted/VBD subterranean/JJ chamber/NN whose/WP$ doorway/NN now/RB framed/VBZ the/DT hideous/JJ narrator/NN ;/: how/WRB he/PRP had/VBD seized/VBN Robert/NNP ,/, son/NN of/IN Godfrey/NNP ,/, in/IN a/DT field/NN ,/, forced/VBD poison/NN down/RP his/PRP$ throat/NN and/CC left/VBD him/PRP to/TO die/VB at/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN thirty-two/JJ ,/, thus/RB maintaining/VBG the/DT foul/JJ provisions/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ vengeful/JJ curse/NN ./. 
At/IN this/DT point/NN I/PRP was/VBD left/VBN to/TO imagine/VB the/DT solution/NN of/IN the/DT greatest/JJS mystery/NN of/IN all/DT ,/, how/WRB the/DT curse/NN had/VBD been/VBN fulfilled/VBN since/IN that/DT time/NN when/WRB Charles/NNP Le/NNP Sorcier/NNP must/MD in/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN nature/NN have/VBP died/VBN ,/, for/IN the/DT man/NN digressed/VBD into/IN an/DT account/NN of/IN the/DT deep/JJ alchemical/JJ studies/NNS of/IN the/DT two/CD wizards/NNS ,/, father/NN and/CC son/NN ,/, speaking/VBG most/JJS particularly/RB of/IN the/DT researches/NNS of/IN Charles/NNP Le/NNP Sorcier/NNP concerning/VBG the/DT elixir/NN which/WDT should/MD grant/VB to/TO him/PRP who/WP partook/VBP of/IN it/PRP eternal/JJ life/NN and/CC youth/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ enthusiasm/NN had/VBD seemed/VBN for/IN the/DT moment/NN to/TO remove/VB from/IN his/PRP$ terrible/JJ eyes/NNS the/DT hatred/NN that/WDT had/VBD at/IN first/RB so/RB haunted/VBN them/PRP ,/, but/CC suddenly/RB the/DT fiendish/JJ glare/NN returned/VBN ,/, and/CC with/IN a/DT shocking/VBG sound/NN like/IN the/DT hissing/NN of/IN a/DT serpent/NN ,/, the/DT stranger/NN raised/VBD a/DT glass/NN phial/NN with/IN the/DT evident/JJ intent/NN of/IN ending/VBG my/PRP$ life/NN as/IN had/VBD Charles/NNP Le/NNP Sorcier/NNP ,/, six/CD hundred/CD years/NNS before/IN ,/, ended/VBD that/IN of/IN my/PRP$ ancestor/NN ./.

Lavinia/NNP was/VBD one/CD who/WP would/MD be/VB apt/JJ to/TO mutter/VB such/JJ things/NNS ,/, for/IN she/PRP was/VBD a/DT lone/JJ creature/NN given/VBN to/TO wandering/VBG amidst/JJ thunderstorms/NNS in/IN the/DT hills/NNS and/CC trying/VBG to/TO read/VB the/DT great/JJ odorous/JJ books/NNS which/WDT her/PRP$ father/NN had/VBD inherited/VBN through/IN two/CD centuries/NNS of/IN Whateleys/NNP ,/, and/CC which/WDT were/VBD fast/RB falling/VBG to/TO pieces/NNS with/IN age/NN and/CC wormholes/NNS ./.

This/DT marked/VBD the/DT beginning/NN of/IN a/DT course/NN of/IN cattle-buying/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN small/JJ Wilbur/NNP 's/POS family/NN which/WDT ended/VBD only/RB in/IN 1928/CD ,/, when/WRB the/DT Dunwich/NNP horror/NN came/VBD and/CC went/VBD ;/: yet/RB at/IN no/DT time/NN did/VBD the/DT ramshackle/NN Whateley/NNP barn/NN seem/NN overcrowded/VBD with/IN livestock/NN ./.

Wilbur/NNP 's/POS growth/NN was/VBD indeed/RB phenomenal/JJ ,/, for/IN within/IN three/CD months/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ birth/NN he/PRP had/VBD attained/VBN a/DT size/NN and/CC muscular/JJ power/NN not/RB usually/RB found/VBN in/IN infants/NNS under/IN a/DT full/JJ year/NN of/IN age/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ motions/NNS and/CC even/RB his/PRP$ vocal/JJ sounds/NNS showed/VBD a/DT restraint/NN and/CC deliberateness/NN highly/RB peculiar/JJ in/IN an/DT infant/NN ,/, and/CC no/DT one/NN was/VBD really/RB unprepared/JJ when/WRB ,/, at/IN seven/CD months/NNS ,/, he/PRP began/VBD to/TO walk/VB unassisted/JJ ,/, with/IN falterings/NNS which/WDT another/DT month/NN was/VBD sufficient/JJ to/TO remove/VB ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD somewhat/RB after/IN this/DT time—on/NN Hallowe'en—that/VBZ a/DT great/JJ blaze/NN was/VBD seen/VBN at/IN midnight/NN on/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN Sentinel/NNP Hill/NNP where/WRB the/DT old/JJ table-like/JJ stone/NN stands/VBZ amidst/RP its/PRP$ tumulus/NN of/IN ancient/JJ bones/NNS ./. 
Considerable/JJ talk/NN was/VBD started/VBN when/WRB Silas/NNP Bishop—of/NNP the/DT undecayed/JJ Bishops—mentioned/NNP having/VBG seen/VBN the/DT boy/NN running/VBG sturdily/RB up/IN that/DT hill/NN ahead/RB of/IN his/PRP$ mother/NN about/IN an/DT hour/NN before/IN the/DT blaze/NN was/VBD remarked/VBN ./.

They/PRP darted/VBD almost/RB noiselessly/RB through/IN the/DT underbrush/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT astonished/JJ watcher/NN seemed/VBD to/TO think/VB they/PRP were/VBD entirely/RB unclothed/JJ ./. 
Afterwards/NNS he/PRP could/MD not/RB be/VB sure/JJ about/IN the/DT boy/NN ,/, who/WP may/MD have/VB had/VBD some/DT kind/NN of/IN a/DT fringed/VBN belt/NN and/CC a/DT pair/NN of/IN dark/JJ trunks/NNS or/CC trousers/NNS on/IN ./. 
Wilbur/NNP was/VBD never/RB subsequently/RB seen/VBN alive/JJ and/CC conscious/JJ without/IN complete/JJ and/CC tightly/RB buttoned/VBN attire/NN ,/, the/DT disarrangement/NN or/CC threatened/JJ disarrangement/NN of/IN which/WDT always/RB seemed/VBD to/TO fill/VB him/PRP with/IN anger/NN and/CC alarm/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ contrast/NN with/IN his/PRP$ squalid/JJ mother/NN and/CC grandfather/NN in/IN this/DT respect/NN was/VBD thought/VBN very/RB notable/JJ until/IN the/DT horror/NN of/IN 1928/CD suggested/VBD the/DT most/RBS valid/JJ of/IN reasons/NNS ./. 
The/DT next/JJ January/NNP gossips/NNS were/VBD mildly/RB interested/JJ in/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN ``/`` Lavinny/NNP 's/POS black/JJ brat/NN ''/'' had/VBD commenced/VBN to/TO talk/VB ,/, and/CC at/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN only/RB eleven/JJ months/NNS ./. 
His/PRP$ speech/NN was/VBD somewhat/RB remarkable/JJ both/DT because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ difference/NN from/IN the/DT ordinary/JJ accents/NNS of/IN the/DT region/NN ,/, and/CC because/IN it/PRP displayed/VBD a/DT freedom/NN from/IN infantile/JJ lisping/NN of/IN which/WDT many/JJ children/NNS of/IN three/CD or/CC four/CD might/MD well/RB be/VB proud/JJ ./. 
The/DT boy/NN was/VBD not/RB talkative/JJ ,/, yet/RB when/WRB he/PRP spoke/VBD he/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO reflect/VB some/DT elusive/JJ element/NN wholly/RB unpossessed/VBN by/IN Dunwich/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ denizens/NNS ./. 
The/DT strangeness/NN did/VBD not/RB reside/VB in/IN what/WP he/PRP said/VBD ,/, or/CC even/RB in/IN the/DT simple/JJ idioms/NNS he/PRP used/VBD ;/: but/CC seemed/VBD vaguely/RB linked/VBN with/IN his/PRP$ intonation/NN or/CC with/IN the/DT internal/JJ organs/NNS that/WDT produced/VBD the/DT spoken/JJ sounds/NNS ./. 
His/PRP$ facial/JJ aspect/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, was/VBD remarkable/JJ for/IN its/PRP$ maturity/NN ;/: for/IN though/IN he/PRP shared/VBD his/PRP$ mother/NN 's/POS and/CC grandfather/NN 's/POS chinlessness/NN ,/, his/PRP$ firm/NN and/CC precociously/RB shaped/VBD nose/RB united/JJ with/IN the/DT expression/NN of/IN his/PRP$ large/JJ ,/, dark/NN ,/, almost/RB Latin/JJ eyes/NNS to/TO give/VB him/PRP an/DT air/NN of/IN quasi-adulthood/NN and/CC well-nigh/JJ preternatural/JJ intelligence/NN ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD ,/, however/RB ,/, exceedingly/RB ugly/RB despite/IN his/PRP$ appearance/NN of/IN brilliancy/NN ;/: there/EX being/VBG something/NN almost/RB goatish/JJ or/CC animalistic/JJ about/IN his/PRP$ thick/JJ lips/NNS ,/, large-pored/JJ ,/, yellowish/JJ skin/NN ,/, coarse/JJ crinkly/NN hair/NN ,/, and/CC oddly/RB elongated/JJ ears/NNS ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD soon/RB disliked/JJ even/RB more/RBR decidedly/RB than/IN his/PRP$ mother/NN and/CC grandsire/NN ,/, and/CC all/DT conjectures/NNS about/IN him/PRP were/VBD spiced/VBN with/IN references/NNS to/TO the/DT bygone/NN magic/NN of/IN Old/NNP Whateley/NNP ,/, and/CC how/WRB the/DT hills/NNS once/RB shook/VBD when/WRB he/PRP shrieked/VBD the/DT dreadful/JJ name/NN of/IN Yog-Sothoth/NNP in/IN the/DT midst/NN of/IN a/DT circle/NN of/IN stones/NNS with/IN a/DT great/JJ book/NN open/JJ in/IN his/PRP$ arms/NNS before/IN him/PRP ./.

Meanwhile/RB Old/NNP Whateley/NNP continued/VBD to/TO buy/VB cattle/NNS without/IN measurably/RB increasing/VBG the/DT size/NN of/IN his/PRP$ head/NN ./. 
He/PRP also/RB cut/VBD timber/NNP and/CC began/VBD to/TO repair/VB the/DT unused/JJ parts/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ house—a/NN spacious/JJ ,/, peak-roofed/JJ affair/NN whose/WP$ rear/JJ end/NN was/VBD buried/VBN entirely/RB in/IN the/DT rocky/JJ hillside/NN ,/, and/CC whose/WP$ three/CD least-ruined/JJ ground-floor/NN rooms/NNS had/VBD always/RB been/VBN sufficient/JJ for/IN himself/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ daughter/NN ./. 
There/EX must/MD have/VB been/VBN prodigious/JJ reserves/NNS of/IN strength/NN in/IN the/DT old/JJ man/NN to/TO enable/VB him/PRP to/TO accomplish/VB so/RB much/JJ hard/JJ labour/NN ;/: and/CC though/IN he/PRP still/RB babbled/VBD dementedly/RB at/IN times/NNS ,/, his/PRP$ carpentry/NN seemed/VBD to/TO show/VB the/DT effects/NNS of/IN sound/JJ calculation/NN ./. 
It/PRP had/VBD already/RB begun/VBN as/RB soon/RB as/IN Wilbur/NNP was/VBD born/VBN ,/, when/WRB one/CD of/IN the/DT many/JJ tool/NN sheds/NNS had/VBD been/VBN put/VBN suddenly/RB in/IN order/NN ,/, clapboarded/VBN ,/, and/CC fitted/VBD with/IN a/DT stout/NN fresh/JJ lock/NN ./.

On/IN Lammas/NNP Night/NNP ,/, 1924/CD ,/, Dr/NNP Houghton/NNP of/IN Aylesbury/NNP was/VBD hastily/RB summoned/VBN by/IN Wilbur/NNP Whateley/NNP ,/, who/WP had/VBD lashed/VBN his/PRP$ one/CD remaining/VBG horse/NN through/IN the/DT darkness/NN and/CC telephoned/VBN from/IN Osborn/NNP 's/POS in/IN the/DT village/NN ./.

He/PRP had/VBD heard/VBN ,/, meanwhile/RB ,/, of/IN Whateley/NNP 's/POS grotesque/NN trip/NN to/TO Cambridge/NNP ,/, and/CC of/IN his/PRP$ frantic/JJ efforts/NNS to/TO borrow/VB or/CC copy/VB from/IN the/DT Necronomicon/NNP at/IN the/DT Widener/NNP Library/NNP ./. 
Those/DT efforts/NNS had/VBD been/VBN in/IN vain/NN ,/, since/IN Armitage/NNP had/VBD issued/VBN warnings/NNS of/IN the/DT keenest/JJS intensity/NN to/TO all/DT librarians/NNS having/VBG charge/NN of/IN the/DT dreaded/JJ volume/NN ./. 
Wilbur/NNP had/VBD been/VBN shockingly/RB nervous/JJ at/IN Cambridge/NNP ;/: anxious/JJ for/IN the/DT book/NN ,/, yet/RB almost/RB equally/RB anxious/JJ to/TO get/VB home/NN again/RB ,/, as/IN if/IN he/PRP feared/VBD the/DT results/NNS of/IN being/VBG away/RB long/RB ./. 
Early/RB in/IN August/NNP the/DT half-expected/JJ outcome/NN developed/VBD ,/, and/CC in/IN the/DT small/JJ hours/NNS of/IN the/DT third/JJ Dr/NNP Armitage/NNP was/VBD awakened/VBN suddenly/RB by/IN the/DT wild/JJ ,/, fierce/JJ cries/NNS of/IN the/DT savage/NN watchdog/NN on/IN the/DT college/NN campus/NN ./. 
Deep/NNP and/CC terrible/JJ ,/, the/DT snarling/NN ,/, half-mad/JJ growls/NN and/CC barks/NNS continued/VBD ;/: always/RB in/IN mounting/VBG volume/NN ,/, but/CC with/IN hideously/RB significant/JJ pauses/NNS ./. 
Then/RB there/EX rang/VBZ out/RP a/DT scream/NN from/IN a/DT wholly/RB different/JJ throat—such/PDT a/DT scream/NN as/IN roused/JJ half/PDT the/DT sleepers/NNS of/IN Arkham/NNP and/CC haunted/VBN their/PRP$ dreams/NNS ever/RB afterwards—such/RB a/DT scream/NN as/IN could/MD come/VB from/IN no/DT being/VBG born/VBN of/IN earth/NN ,/, or/CC wholly/RB of/IN earth/NN ./. 
Armitage/NN ,/, hastening/VBG into/IN some/DT clothing/NN and/CC rushing/VBG across/IN the/DT street/NN and/CC lawn/NN to/TO the/DT college/NN buildings/NNS ,/, saw/VBD that/IN others/NNS were/VBD ahead/RB of/IN him/PRP ;/: and/CC heard/VB the/DT echoes/NNS of/IN a/DT burglar-alarm/NN still/RB shrilling/VBG from/IN the/DT library/NN ./. 
An/DT open/JJ window/NN showed/VBD black/JJ and/CC gaping/VBG in/IN the/DT moonlight/NN ./. 
What/WP had/VBD come/VBN had/VBD indeed/RB completed/VBN its/PRP$ entrance/NN ;/: for/IN the/DT barking/NN and/CC the/DT screaming/NN ,/, now/RB fast/RB fading/VBG into/IN a/DT mixed/JJ low/JJ growling/NN and/CC moaning/NN ,/, proceeded/VBD unmistakably/RB from/IN within/IN ./. 
Some/DT instinct/NN warned/VBD Armitage/NNP that/IN what/WP was/VBD taking/VBG place/NN was/VBD not/RB a/DT thing/NN for/IN unfortified/JJ eyes/NNS to/TO see/VB ,/, so/IN he/PRP brushed/VBD back/RP the/DT crowd/NN with/IN authority/NN as/IN he/PRP unlocked/VBD the/DT vestibule/NN door/NN ./. 
Among/IN the/DT others/NNS he/PRP saw/VBD Professor/NNP Warren/NNP Rice/NNP and/CC Dr/NNP Francis/NNP Morgan/NNP ,/, men/NNS to/TO whom/WP he/PRP had/VBD told/VBN some/DT of/IN his/PRP$ conjectures/NNS and/CC misgivings/NNS ;/: and/CC these/DT two/CD he/PRP motioned/VBD to/TO accompany/VB him/PRP inside/RB ./. 
The/DT inward/NN sounds/VBZ ,/, except/IN for/IN a/DT watchful/JJ ,/, droning/VBG whine/NN from/IN the/DT dog/NN ,/, had/VBN by/IN this/DT time/NN quite/RB subsided/VBD ;/: but/CC Armitage/NNP now/RB perceived/VBZ with/IN a/DT sudden/JJ start/NN that/IN a/DT loud/JJ chorus/NN of/IN whippoorwills/NNS among/IN the/DT shrubbery/NN had/VBD commenced/VBN a/DT damnably/RB rhythmical/JJ piping/NN ,/, as/IN if/IN in/IN unison/NN with/IN the/DT last/JJ breaths/NNS of/IN a/DT dying/VBG man/NN ./. 
The/DT building/NN was/VBD full/JJ of/IN a/DT frightful/JJ stench/NN which/WDT Dr/NNP Armitage/NNP knew/VBD too/RB well/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT three/CD men/NNS rushed/VBN across/IN the/DT hall/NN to/TO the/DT small/JJ genealogical/JJ reading-room/NN whence/NN the/DT low/JJ whining/NN came/VBD ./. 
For/IN a/DT second/JJ nobody/NN dared/VBD to/TO turn/VB on/IN the/DT light/NN ,/, then/RB Armitage/NNP summoned/VBD up/RP his/PRP$ courage/NN and/CC snapped/VBD the/DT switch/NN ./. 
One/CD of/IN the/DT three—it/NN is/VBZ not/RB certain/JJ which—shrieked/VBD aloud/NN at/IN what/WP sprawled/VBD before/IN them/PRP among/IN disordered/JJ tables/NNS and/CC overturned/VBN chairs/NNS ./. 
Professor/NNP Rice/NNP declares/VBZ that/IN he/PRP wholly/RB lost/VBD consciousness/NN for/IN an/DT instant/NN ,/, though/IN he/PRP did/VBD not/RB stumble/JJ or/CC fall/NN ./. 
The/DT thing/NN that/WDT lay/VBD half-bent/NN on/IN its/PRP$ side/NN in/IN a/DT foetid/JJ pool/NN of/IN greenish-yellow/JJ ichor/NN and/CC tarry/NN stickiness/NN was/VBD almost/RB nine/CD feet/NNS tall/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT dog/NN had/VBD torn/VBN off/RP all/DT the/DT clothing/NN and/CC some/DT of/IN the/DT skin/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB quite/RB dead/JJ ,/, but/CC twitched/VBD silently/RB and/CC spasmodically/RB while/IN its/PRP$ chest/JJS heaved/VBN in/IN monstrous/JJ unison/NN with/IN the/DT mad/JJ piping/NN of/IN the/DT expectant/JJ whippoorwills/NNS outside/IN ./. 
Bits/NNS of/IN shoe-leather/NN and/CC fragments/NNS of/IN apparel/NN were/VBD scattered/VBN about/IN the/DT room/NN ,/, and/CC just/RB inside/IN the/DT window/NN an/DT empty/JJ canvas/NN sack/NN lay/NN where/WRB it/PRP had/VBD evidently/RB been/VBN thrown/VBN ./. 
Near/IN the/DT central/JJ desk/NN a/DT revolver/NN had/VBD fallen/VBN ,/, a/DT dented/VBN but/CC undischarged/VBN cartridge/NN later/RBR explaining/VBG why/WRB it/PRP had/VBD not/RB been/VBN fired/VBN ./. 
The/DT thing/NN itself/PRP ,/, however/RB ,/, crowded/VBD out/RP all/DT other/JJ images/NNS at/IN the/DT time/NN ./. 
It/PRP would/MD be/VB trite/JJ and/CC not/RB wholly/RB accurate/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN no/DT human/JJ pen/NN could/MD describe/VB it/PRP ,/, but/CC one/CD may/MD properly/VB say/VB that/IN it/PRP could/MD not/RB be/VB vividly/RB visualized/VBN by/IN anyone/NN whose/WP$ ideas/NNS of/IN aspect/NN and/CC contour/NN are/VBP too/RB closely/RB bound/VBN up/RP with/IN the/DT common/JJ life-forms/NNS of/IN this/DT planet/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT three/CD known/VBN dimensions/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD partly/RB human/JJ ,/, beyond/IN a/DT doubt/NN ,/, with/IN very/RB manlike/JJ hands/NNS and/CC head/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT goatish/NN ,/, chinless/JJ face/NN had/VBD the/DT stamp/NN of/IN the/DT Whateley/NNP 's/POS upon/IN it/PRP ./. 
But/CC the/DT torso/NN and/CC lower/JJR parts/NNS of/IN the/DT body/NN were/VBD teratologically/RB fabulous/JJ ,/, so/IN that/IN only/RB generous/JJ clothing/NN could/MD ever/RB have/VB enabled/VBN it/PRP to/TO walk/VB on/IN earth/NN unchallenged/VBD or/CC uneradicated/JJ ./. 
Above/IN the/DT waist/NN it/PRP was/VBD semi-anthropomorphic/JJ ;/: though/IN its/PRP$ chest/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT dog/NN 's/POS rending/NN paws/NN still/RB rested/VBN watchfully/RB ,/, had/VBD the/DT leathery/NN ,/, reticulated/VBD hide/NN of/IN a/DT crocodile/NN or/CC alligator/NN ./. 
The/DT back/NN was/VBD piebald/VBN with/IN yellow/JJ and/CC black/JJ ,/, and/CC dimly/RB suggested/VBD the/DT squamous/JJ covering/NN of/IN certain/JJ snakes/NNS ./. 
Below/IN the/DT waist/NN ,/, though/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD the/DT worst/JJS ;/: for/IN here/RB all/DT human/JJ resemblance/NN left/VBD off/RP and/CC sheer/VB phantasy/NN began/VBD ./. 
The/DT skin/NN was/VBD thickly/RB covered/VBN with/IN coarse/JJ black/JJ fur/NN ,/, and/CC from/IN the/DT abdomen/NNS a/DT score/NN of/IN long/JJ greenish-grey/JJ tentacles/NNS with/IN red/JJ sucking/VBG mouths/NNS protruded/VBD limply/RB ./. 
Their/PRP$ arrangement/NN was/VBD odd/JJ ,/, and/CC seemed/VBD to/TO follow/VB the/DT symmetries/NNS of/IN some/DT cosmic/JJ geometry/NN unknown/JJ to/TO earth/VB or/CC the/DT solar/JJ system/NN ./. 
On/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT hips/NNS ,/, deep/JJ set/NN in/IN a/DT kind/NN of/IN pinkish/NN ,/, ciliated/VBN orbit/NN ,/, was/VBD what/WP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT rudimentary/JJ eye/NN ;/: whilst/CC in/IN lieu/NN of/IN a/DT tail/NN there/RB depended/VBD a/DT kind/NN of/IN trunk/NN or/CC feeler/NN with/IN purple/JJ annular/JJ markings/NNS ,/, and/CC with/IN many/JJ evidences/NNS of/IN being/VBG an/DT undeveloped/JJ mouth/NN or/CC throat/NN ./. 
The/DT limbs/NN ,/, save/VB for/IN their/PRP$ black/JJ fur/NN ,/, roughly/RB resembled/VBD the/DT hind/NN legs/NN of/IN prehistoric/JJ earth/NN 's/POS giant/JJ saurians/NNS ,/, and/CC terminated/VBN in/IN ridgy-veined/JJ pads/NNS that/WDT were/VBD neither/DT hooves/NNS nor/CC claws/NNS ./. 
When/WRB the/DT thing/NN breathed/VBD ,/, its/PRP$ tail/NN and/CC tentacles/NNS rhythmically/RB changed/VBD colour/NN ,/, as/IN if/IN from/IN some/DT circulatory/NN cause/NN normal/JJ to/TO the/DT non-human/JJ greenish/JJ tinge/NN ,/, whilst/NN in/IN the/DT tail/NN it/PRP was/VBD manifest/RB as/IN a/DT yellowish/JJ appearance/NN which/WDT alternated/VBD with/IN a/DT sickly/JJ grayish-white/NN in/IN the/DT spaces/NNS between/IN the/DT purple/JJ rings/NNS ./. 
Of/IN genuine/JJ blood/NN there/EX was/VBD none/NN ;/: only/RB the/DT foetid/JJ greenish-yellow/JJ ichor/NN which/WDT trickled/VBD along/IN the/DT painted/JJ floor/NN beyond/IN the/DT radius/NN of/IN the/DT stickiness/NN ,/, and/CC left/VBD a/DT curious/JJ discoloration/NN behind/IN it/PRP ./. 
As/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN the/DT three/CD men/NNS seemed/VBD to/TO rouse/VB the/DT dying/VBG thing/NN ,/, it/PRP began/VBD to/TO mumble/VB without/IN turning/VBG or/CC raising/VBG its/PRP$ head/NN ./. 
Dr/NNP Armitage/NNP made/VBD no/DT written/VBN record/NN of/IN its/PRP$ mouthings/NNS ,/, but/CC asserts/VBZ confidently/RB that/IN nothing/NN in/IN English/NNP was/VBD uttered/VBN ./. 
At/IN first/RB the/DT syllables/NNS defied/VBD all/DT correlation/NN with/IN any/DT speech/NN of/IN earth/NN ,/, but/CC towards/VBZ the/DT last/JJ there/EX came/VBD some/DT disjointed/JJ fragments/NNS evidently/RB taken/VBN from/IN the/DT Necronomicon/NNP ,/, that/IN monstrous/JJ blasphemy/NN in/IN quest/NN of/IN which/WDT the/DT thing/NN had/VBD perished/VBN ./. 
These/DT fragments/NNS ,/, as/IN Armitage/NNP recalls/VBZ them/PRP ,/, ran/VBD something/NN like/IN ./. 
They/PRP trailed/VBD off/RP into/IN nothingness/NN as/IN the/DT whippoorwills/NNS shrieked/VBN in/IN rhythmical/JJ crescendos/NN of/IN unholy/JJ anticipation/NN ./. 
Then/RB came/VBD a/DT halt/NN in/IN the/DT gasping/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT dog/NN raised/VBD its/PRP$ head/NN in/IN a/DT long/JJ ,/, lugubrious/JJ howl/NN ./. 
A/DT change/NN came/VBD over/IN the/DT yellow/JJ ,/, goatish/JJ face/NN of/IN the/DT prostrate/JJ thing/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT great/JJ black/JJ eyes/NNS fell/VBD in/IN appallingly/RB ./. 
Outside/IN the/DT window/NN the/DT shrilling/NN of/IN the/DT whippoorwills/NNS had/VBD suddenly/RB ceased/VBN ,/, and/CC above/IN the/DT murmurs/NN of/IN the/DT gathering/NN crowd/NN there/RB came/VBD the/DT sound/NN of/IN a/DT panic-struck/JJ whirring/NN and/CC fluttering/NN ./. 
Against/IN the/DT moon/NN vast/JJ clouds/NN of/IN feathery/NN watchers/NNS rose/VBD and/CC raced/VBD from/IN sight/NN ,/, frantic/JJ at/IN that/DT which/WDT they/PRP had/VBD sought/VBN for/IN prey/NN ./. 
All/DT at/IN once/RB the/DT dog/NN started/VBD up/RB abruptly/RB ,/, gave/VBD a/DT frightened/JJ bark/NN ,/, and/CC leaped/VBD nervously/RB out/IN of/IN the/DT window/NN by/IN which/WDT it/PRP had/VBD entered/VBN ./. 
A/DT cry/NN rose/VBD from/IN the/DT crowd/NN ,/, and/CC Dr/NNP Armitage/NNP shouted/VBD to/TO the/DT men/NNS outside/IN that/DT no/DT one/NN must/MD be/VB admitted/VBN till/IN the/DT police/NN or/CC medical/JJ examiner/NN came/VBD ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD thankful/JJ that/IN the/DT windows/NNS were/VBD just/RB too/RB high/JJ to/TO permit/VB of/IN peering/VBG in/IN ,/, and/CC drew/VBD the/DT dark/NN curtains/VBZ carefully/RB down/RB over/IN each/DT one/CD ./. 
By/IN this/DT time/NN two/CD policemen/NNS had/VBD arrived/VBN ;/: and/CC Dr/NNP Morgan/NNP ,/, meeting/VBG them/PRP in/IN the/DT vestibule/NN ,/, was/VBD urging/VBG them/PRP for/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ sakes/NNS to/TO postpone/VB entrance/NN to/TO the/DT stench-filled/JJ reading-room/NN till/IN the/DT examiner/NN came/VBD and/CC the/DT prostrate/JJ thing/NN could/MD be/VB covered/VBN up/RP ./. 
Meanwhile/RB frightful/JJ changes/NNS were/VBD taking/VBG place/NN on/IN the/DT floor/NN ./. 
One/CD need/MD not/RB describe/VB the/DT kind/NN and/CC rate/NN of/IN shrinkage/NN and/CC disintegration/NN that/WDT occurred/VBD before/IN the/DT eyes/NNS of/IN Dr/NNP Armitage/NNP and/CC Professor/NNP Rice/NNP ;/: but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ permissible/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN ,/, aside/RB from/IN the/DT external/JJ appearance/NN of/IN face/NN and/CC hands/NNS ,/, the/DT really/RB human/JJ element/NN in/IN Wilbur/NNP Whateley/NNP must/MD have/VB been/VBN very/RB small/JJ ./. 
When/WRB the/DT medical/JJ examiner/NN came/VBD ,/, there/EX was/VBD only/RB a/DT sticky/JJ whitish/JJ mass/NN on/IN the/DT painted/JJ boards/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT monstrous/JJ odour/NN had/VBD nearly/RB disappeared/VBN ./.

About/RB two/CD in/IN the/DT morning/NN a/DT frightful/JJ stench/NN and/CC the/DT savage/NN barking/NN of/IN the/DT dogs/NNS awakened/VBD the/DT household/NN at/IN Elmer/NNP Frye/NNP 's/POS ,/, on/IN the/DT eastern/JJ edge/NN of/IN Cold/NNP Spring/NNP Glen/NNP ,/, and/CC all/DT agreed/VBD that/IN they/PRP could/MD hear/VB a/DT sort/NN of/IN muffled/JJ swishing/NN or/CC lapping/VBG sound/NN from/IN somewhere/JJ outside/NN ./. 
Mrs/NNP Frye/NNP proposed/VBD telephoning/VBG the/DT neighbours/NNS ,/, and/CC Elmer/NNP was/VBD about/IN to/TO agree/VB when/WRB the/DT noise/NN of/IN splintering/VBG wood/NN burst/NN in/IN upon/IN their/PRP$ deliberations/NNS ./. 
It/PRP came/VBD ,/, apparently/RB ,/, from/IN the/DT barn/NN ;/: and/CC was/VBD quickly/RB followed/VBN by/IN a/DT hideous/JJ screaming/NN and/CC stamping/VBG amongst/RP the/DT cattle/NNS ./. 
The/DT dogs/NNS slavered/VBD and/CC crouched/VBD close/RB to/TO the/DT feet/NNS of/IN the/DT fear-numbed/JJ family/NN ./. 
Frye/NNP lit/VBD a/DT lantern/JJ through/IN force/NN of/IN habit/NN ,/, but/CC knew/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB death/NN to/TO go/VB out/RP into/IN that/DT black/JJ farmyard/NN ./. 
The/DT children/NNS and/CC the/DT women-folk/NN whimpered/VBD ,/, kept/VBD from/IN screaming/VBG by/IN some/DT obscure/NN ,/, vestigial/JJ instinct/NN of/IN defence/NN which/WDT told/VBD them/PRP their/PRP$ lives/NNS depended/VBN on/IN silence/NN ./. 
At/IN last/JJ the/DT noise/NN of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS subsided/VBD to/TO a/DT pitiful/JJ moaning/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT great/JJ snapping/NN ,/, crashing/NN ,/, and/CC crackling/VBG ensued/VBN ./. 
The/DT Fryes/NNP ,/, huddled/VBD together/RB in/IN the/DT sitting-room/NN ,/, did/VBD not/RB dare/VB to/TO move/VB until/IN the/DT last/JJ echoes/NNS died/VBD away/RB far/RB down/RP in/IN Cold/NNP Spring/NNP Glen/NNP ./. 
Then/RB ,/, amidst/IN the/DT dismal/JJ moans/NNS from/IN the/DT stable/JJ and/CC the/DT daemoniac/JJ piping/NN of/IN the/DT late/JJ whippoorwills/NNS in/IN the/DT glen/NN ,/, Selina/NNP Frye/NNP tottered/VBD to/TO the/DT telephone/NN and/CC spread/VBD what/WP news/NN she/PRP could/MD of/IN the/DT second/JJ phase/NN of/IN the/DT horror/NN ./. 
The/DT next/JJ day/NN all/PDT the/DT countryside/NN was/VBD in/IN a/DT panic/NN ;/: and/CC cowed/VBD ,/, uncommunicative/JJ groups/NNS came/VBD and/CC went/VBD where/WRB the/DT fiendish/JJ thing/NN had/VBD occurred/VBN ./. 
Two/CD titan/JJ swaths/NNS of/IN destruction/NN stretched/VBN from/IN the/DT glen/NN to/TO the/DT Frye/NNP farmyard/NN ,/, monstrous/JJ prints/NNS covered/VBD the/DT bare/NN patches/NNS of/IN ground/NN ,/, and/CC one/CD side/NN of/IN the/DT old/JJ red/JJ barn/NN had/VBD completely/RB caved/VBN in/IN ./. 
Of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS ,/, only/RB a/DT quarter/NN could/MD be/VB found/VBN and/CC identified/VBN ./. 
Some/DT of/IN these/DT were/VBD in/IN curious/JJ fragments/NNS ,/, and/CC all/PDT that/DT survived/VBD had/VBD to/TO be/VB shot/VBN ./. 
Earl/NNP Sawyer/NNP suggested/VBD that/IN help/NN be/VB asked/VBN from/IN Aylesbury/NNP or/CC Arkham/NNP ,/, but/CC others/NNS maintained/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB of/IN no/DT use/NN ./. 
Old/NNP Zebulon/NNP Whateley/NNP ,/, of/IN a/DT branch/NN that/WDT hovered/VBD about/IN halfway/NN between/IN soundness/NN and/CC decadence/NN ,/, made/VBD darkly/JJ wild/JJ suggestions/NNS about/IN rites/NNS that/WDT ought/MD to/TO be/VB practiced/VBN on/IN the/DT hill-tops/NNS ./. 
He/PRP came/VBD of/IN a/DT line/NN where/WRB tradition/NN ran/VBD strong/JJ ,/, and/CC his/PRP$ memories/NNS of/IN chantings/NNS in/IN the/DT great/JJ stone/NN circles/NNS were/VBD not/RB altogether/RB connected/VBN with/IN Wilbur/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ grandfather/NN ./. 
Darkness/NNP fell/VBD upon/IN a/DT stricken/JJ countryside/NN too/RB passive/JJ to/TO organize/VB for/IN real/JJ defence/NN ./. 
In/IN a/DT few/JJ cases/NNS closely/RB related/JJ families/NNS would/MD band/VB together/RB and/CC watch/VB in/IN the/DT gloom/NN under/IN one/CD roof/NN ;/: but/CC in/IN general/JJ there/EX was/VBD only/RB a/DT repetition/NN of/IN the/DT barricading/NN of/IN the/DT night/NN before/IN ,/, and/CC a/DT futile/NN ,/, ineffective/JJ gesture/NN of/IN loading/VBG muskets/NNS and/CC setting/VBG pitchforks/NNS handily/RB about/IN ./. 
Nothing/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, occurred/VBD except/IN some/DT hill/NN noises/NNS ;/: and/CC when/WRB the/DT day/NN came/VBD there/EX were/VBD many/JJ who/WP hoped/VBD that/IN the/DT new/JJ horror/NN had/VBD gone/VBN as/RB swiftly/RB as/IN it/PRP had/VBD come/VBN ./. 
There/EX were/VBD even/RB bold/JJ souls/NNS who/WP proposed/VBD an/DT offensive/JJ expedition/NN down/RB in/IN the/DT glen/NN ,/, though/IN they/PRP did/VBD not/RB venture/NN to/TO set/VB an/DT actual/JJ example/NN to/TO the/DT still/RB reluctant/JJ majority/NN ./. 
When/WRB night/NN came/VBD again/RB the/DT barricading/NN was/VBD repeated/VBN ,/, though/IN there/EX was/VBD less/JJR huddling/VBG together/RB of/IN families/NNS ./. 
In/IN the/DT morning/NN both/CC the/DT Frye/NNP and/CC the/DT Seth/NNP Bishop/NNP households/NNS reported/VBD excitement/NN among/IN the/DT dogs/NNS and/CC vague/JJ sounds/NNS and/CC stenches/NNS from/IN afar/NN ,/, while/IN early/JJ explorers/NNS noted/VBD with/IN horror/NN a/DT fresh/JJ set/NN of/IN the/DT monstrous/JJ tracks/NNS in/IN the/DT road/NN skirting/VBG Sentinel/NNP Hill/NNP ./. 
As/IN before/RB ,/, the/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT road/NN showed/VBD a/DT bruising/VBG indicative/NN of/IN the/DT blasphemously/RB stupendous/JJ bulk/NN of/IN the/DT horror/NN ;/: whilst/CC the/DT conformation/NN of/IN the/DT tracks/NNS seemed/VBD to/TO argue/VB a/DT passage/NN in/IN two/CD directions/NNS ,/, as/IN if/IN the/DT moving/VBG mountain/NN had/VBD come/VBN from/IN Cold/NNP Spring/NNP Glen/NNP and/CC returned/VBN to/TO it/PRP along/IN the/DT same/JJ path/NN ./. 
At/IN the/DT base/NN of/IN the/DT hill/NN a/DT thirty-foot/JJ swath/NN of/IN crushed/JJ shrubbery/NN saplings/NNS led/VBD steeply/NN upwards/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT seekers/NNS gasped/VBD when/WRB they/PRP saw/VBD that/IN even/RB the/DT most/RBS perpendicular/JJ places/NNS did/VBD not/RB deflect/VB the/DT inexorable/JJ trail/NN ./. 
Whatever/WDT the/DT horror/NN was/VBD ,/, it/PRP could/MD scale/VB a/DT sheer/NN stony/NN cliff/NN of/IN almost/RB complete/JJ verticality/NN ;/: and/CC as/IN the/DT investigators/NNS climbed/VBD round/NN to/TO the/DT hill/NN 's/POS summit/NN by/IN safer/JJR routes/NNS they/PRP saw/VBD that/IN the/DT trail/NN ended—or/NN rather/RB ,/, reversed—there/RB ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD here/RB that/IN the/DT Whateleys/NNP used/VBD to/TO build/VB their/PRP$ hellish/JJ fires/NNS and/CC chant/VB their/PRP$ hellish/JJ rituals/NNS by/IN the/DT table-like/JJ stone/NN on/IN May/NNP Eve/NNP and/CC Hallowmass/NNP ./. 
Now/RB that/DT very/RB stone/NN formed/VBD the/DT centre/NN of/IN a/DT vast/JJ space/NN thrashed/VBN around/IN by/IN the/DT mountainous/JJ horror/NN ,/, whilst/WP upon/IN its/PRP$ slightly/RB concave/VBP surface/NN was/VBD a/DT thick/NN and/CC foetid/JJ deposit/NN of/IN the/DT same/JJ tarry/NN stickiness/NN observed/VBD on/IN the/DT floor/NN of/IN the/DT ruined/JJ Whateley/NNP farmhouse/NN when/WRB the/DT horror/NN escaped/VBD ./. 
Men/NN looked/VBD at/IN one/CD another/DT and/CC muttered/VBN ./. 
Then/RB they/PRP looked/VBD down/RP the/DT hill/NN ./. 
Apparently/RB the/DT horror/NN had/VBD descended/VBN by/IN a/DT route/NN much/RB the/DT same/JJ as/IN that/DT of/IN its/PRP$ ascent/NN ./. 
To/TO speculate/VB was/VBD futile/JJ ./. 
Reason/NNP ,/, logic/NN ,/, and/CC normal/JJ ideas/NNS of/IN motivation/NN stood/VBD confounded/VBN ./. 
Only/RB old/JJ Zebulon/NNP ,/, who/WP was/VBD not/RB with/IN the/DT group/NN ,/, could/MD have/VB done/VBN justice/NN to/TO the/DT situation/NN or/CC suggested/VBD a/DT plausible/JJ explanation/NN ./. 

﻿It/NN was/VBD a/DT chilly/JJ November/NNP afternoon/NN ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD just/RB consummated/VBN an/DT unusually/RB hearty/JJ dinner/NN ,/, of/IN which/WDT the/DT dyspeptic/JJ truffe/NN formed/VBD not/RB the/DT least/JJS important/JJ item/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD sitting/VBG alone/RB in/IN the/DT dining-room/NN with/IN my/PRP$ feet/NNS upon/IN the/DT fender/NN and/CC at/IN my/PRP$ elbow/NN a/DT small/JJ table/NN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD rolled/VBN up/RP to/TO the/DT fire/NN ,/, and/CC upon/IN which/WDT were/VBD some/DT apologies/NNS for/IN dessert/NN ,/, with/IN some/DT miscellaneous/JJ bottles/NNS of/IN wine/NN ,/, spirit/NN ,/, and/CC liqueur/NN ./.

I/PRP made/VBD effort/NN to/TO arouse/VB myself/PRP by/IN frequent/JJ aid/NN of/IN Lafitte/NNP ,/, and/CC all/DT failing/NN ,/, I/PRP betook/VBP myself/PRP to/TO a/DT stray/JJ newspaper/NN in/IN despair/NN ./.

Upon/IN examining/VBG it/PRP I/PRP discovered/VBD that/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT raisin/NN stems/VBZ which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN filiping/VBG about/IN the/DT room/NN during/IN the/DT discourse/NN of/IN the/DT Angel/NNP of/IN the/DT Odd/NNP had/VBD flown/VBN through/IN the/DT fractured/JJ crystal/NN ,/, and/CC lodging/NN ,/, singularly/RB enough/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT keyhole/NN ,/, with/IN an/DT end/NN projecting/VBG outward/NN ,/, had/VBD thus/RB arrested/VBN the/DT revolution/NN of/IN the/DT minute/NN hand/NN ./.

I/PRP gave/VBD the/DT matter/NN no/DT further/JJ consideration/NN ,/, and/CC at/IN my/PRP$ usual/JJ hour/NN retired/VBD to/TO bed/NN ./.

My/PRP$ dreams/NNS were/VBD terrifically/RB disturbed/VBN by/IN visions/NNS of/IN the/DT Angel/NNP of/IN the/DT Odd/NNP ./.

My/PRP$ agony/NN was/VBD at/IN length/NN insufferable/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP awoke/VBD just/RB in/IN time/NN to/TO perceive/VB that/IN a/DT rat/NN had/VBD run/VBN off/RP with/IN the/DT lighted/VBN candle/NN from/IN the/DT stand/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB in/IN season/NN to/TO prevent/VB his/PRP$ making/VBG his/PRP$ escape/NN with/IN it/PRP through/IN the/DT hole/NN ,/, Very/RB soon/RB a/DT strong/JJ ,/, suffocating/VBG odor/NN assailed/VBD my/PRP$ nostrils/NNS ;/: the/DT house/NN ,/, I/PRP clearly/RB perceived/VBD ,/, was/VBD on/IN fire/NN ./.

All/DT egress/NN from/IN my/PRP$ chamber/NN ,/, except/IN through/IN a/DT window/NN ,/, was/VBD cut/VBN off/RP ./. 
The/DT crowd/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, quickly/RB procured/VBD and/CC raised/VBD a/DT long/JJ ladder/NN ./. 
By/IN means/NNS of/IN this/DT I/PRP was/VBD descending/VBG rapidly/RB ,/, and/CC in/IN apparent/JJ safety/NN ,/, when/WRB a/DT huge/JJ hog/NN ,/, about/IN whose/WP$ rotund/NN stomach/NN ,/, and/CC indeed/RB about/IN whose/WP$ whole/JJ air/NN and/CC physiognomy/NN ,/, there/EX was/VBD something/NN which/WDT reminded/VBD me/PRP of/IN the/DT Angel/NNP of/IN the/DT Odd—when/NNP this/DT hog/NN ,/, I/PRP say/VBP ,/, which/WDT hitherto/VBP had/VBD been/VBN quietly/RB slumbering/VBG in/IN the/DT mud/NN ,/, took/VBD it/PRP suddenly/RB into/IN his/PRP$ head/NN that/IN his/PRP$ left/JJ shoulder/NN needed/VBD scratching/NN ,/, and/CC could/MD find/VB no/DT more/RBR convenient/JJ rubbing-post/NN than/IN that/DT afforded/VBN by/IN the/DT foot/NN of/IN the/DT ladder/NN ./. 
In/IN an/DT instant/NN I/PRP was/VBD precipitated/VBN ,/, and/CC had/VBD the/DT misfortune/NN to/TO fracture/VB my/PRP$ arm/NN ./.

She/PRP blushed/VBD and/CC bowed/VBD her/PRP$ luxuriant/JJ tresses/NNS into/IN close/JJ contact/NN with/IN those/DT supplied/VBN me/PRP temporarily/RB by/IN Grandjean/NNP ./. 
I/PRP know/VBP not/RB how/WRB the/DT entanglement/NN took/VBD place/NN but/CC so/IN it/PRP was/VBD ./. 
I/PRP arose/VBP with/IN a/DT shining/VBG pate/NN ,/, wigless/NN ;/: she/PRP in/IN disdain/NN and/CC wrath/NN ,/, half-buried/JJ in/IN alien/JJ hair/NN ./.

Without/IN despairing/VBG ,/, however/RB ,/, I/PRP undertook/VBP the/DT siege/NN of/IN a/DT less/RBR implacable/JJ heart/NN ./. 
The/DT fates/NNS were/VBD again/RB propitious/JJ for/IN a/DT brief/JJ period/NN ,/, but/CC again/RB a/DT trivial/JJ incident/NN interfered/VBN ./. 
Meeting/VBG my/PRP$ betrothed/VBN in/IN an/DT avenue/NN thronged/VBD with/IN the/DT elite/NN of/IN the/DT city/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD hastening/VBG to/TO greet/VB her/PRP with/IN one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ best/JJS considered/VBN bows/NNS ,/, when/WRB a/DT small/JJ particle/NN of/IN some/DT foreign/JJ matter/NN lodging/VBG in/IN the/DT corner/NN of/IN my/PRP$ eye/NN rendered/VBD me/PRP for/IN the/DT moment/NN completely/RB blind/IN ./. 
Before/IN I/PRP could/MD recover/VB my/PRP$ sight/NN ,/, the/DT lady/NN of/IN my/PRP$ love/NN had/VBD disappeared—irreparably/RB affronted/VBN at/IN what/WP she/PRP chose/VBD to/TO consider/VB my/PRP$ premeditated/JJ rudeness/NN in/IN passing/VBG her/PRP$ by/IN ungreeted/JJ ./.

He/PRP examined/VBD my/PRP$ disordered/JJ eye/NN with/IN much/JJ gentleness/NN and/CC skill/NN ,/, informed/VBD me/PRP that/IN I/PRP had/VBD a/DT drop/NN in/IN it/PRP ,/, and/CC (/( whatever/VB a/DT ``/`` drop/NN ''/'' was/VBD )/) took/VBD it/PRP out/RP ,/, and/CC afforded/VBD me/PRP relief/NN ./. 
I/PRP now/RB considered/VBD it/PRP high/JJ time/NN to/TO die/VB (/( since/IN fortune/NN had/VBD so/RB determined/VBN to/TO persecute/VB me/PRP )/) ,/, and/CC accordingly/RB made/VBD my/PRP$ way/NN to/TO the/DT nearest/JJS river/NN ./. 
Here/RB ,/, divesting/VBG myself/PRP of/IN my/PRP$ clothes/NNS (/( for/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT reason/NN why/WRB we/PRP can/MD not/RB die/VB as/IN we/PRP were/VBD born/VBN )/) ,/, I/PRP threw/VBD myself/PRP headlong/RB into/IN the/DT current/JJ ;/: the/DT sole/JJ witness/NN of/IN my/PRP$ fate/NN being/VBG a/DT solitary/JJ crow/NN that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN seduced/VBN into/IN the/DT eating/NN of/IN brandy-saturated/JJ corn/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB had/VBD staggered/VBN away/RB from/IN his/PRP$ fellows/NNS ./. 
No/DT sooner/NN had/VBD I/PRP entered/VBD the/DT water/NN than/IN this/DT bird/NN took/VBD it/PRP into/IN his/PRP$ head/NN to/TO fly/VB away/RB with/IN the/DT most/RBS indispensable/JJ portion/NN of/IN my/PRP$ apparel/NN ./. 
Postponing/VBG ,/, therefore/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT present/JJ ,/, my/PRP$ suicidal/JJ design/NN ,/, I/PRP just/RB slipped/VBD my/PRP$ nether/JJ extremities/NNS into/IN the/DT sleeves/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ coat/NN ,/, and/CC betook/VB myself/PRP to/TO a/DT pursuit/NN of/IN the/DT felon/NN with/IN all/PDT the/DT nimbleness/NN which/WDT the/DT case/NN required/VBN and/CC its/PRP$ circumstances/NNS would/MD admit/VB ./. 
But/CC my/PRP$ evil/JJ destiny/NN attended/VBD me/PRP still/RB ./. 
As/IN I/PRP ran/VBP at/IN full/JJ speed/NN ,/, with/IN my/PRP$ nose/JJ up/RP in/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN ,/, and/CC intent/NN only/RB upon/IN the/DT purloiner/NN of/IN my/PRP$ property/NN ,/, I/PRP suddenly/RB perceived/VBD that/IN my/PRP$ feet/NNS rested/VBD no/RB longer/RBR upon/IN terra/JJ firma/NN ;/: the/DT fact/NN is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP had/VBD thrown/VBN myself/PRP over/IN a/DT precipice/NN ,/, and/CC should/MD inevitably/RB have/VB been/VBN dashed/VBN to/TO pieces/NNS but/CC for/IN my/PRP$ good/JJ fortune/NN in/IN grasping/VBG the/DT end/NN of/IN a/DT long/JJ guide-rope/NN ,/, which/WDT depended/VBD from/IN a/DT passing/NN balloon/NN ./. 
As/RB soon/RB as/IN I/PRP sufficiently/RB recovered/VBD my/PRP$ senses/NNS to/TO comprehend/VB the/DT terrific/JJ predicament/NN in/IN which/WDT I/PRP stood/VBD ,/, or/CC rather/RB hung/NN ,/, I/PRP exerted/VBD all/PDT the/DT power/NN of/IN my/PRP$ lungs/NNS to/TO make/VB that/DT predicament/NN known/VBN to/TO the/DT aeronaut/JJ overhead/NN ./. 
But/CC for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN I/PRP exerted/VBD myself/PRP in/IN vain/NN ./. 
Either/CC the/DT fool/NN could/MD not/RB ,/, or/CC the/DT villain/NN would/MD not/RB perceive/VB me/PRP ./. 
Meanwhile/RB the/DT machine/NN rapidly/RB soared/VBD ,/, while/IN my/PRP$ strength/NN even/RB more/RBR rapidly/RB failed/VBD ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD soon/RB upon/IN the/DT point/NN of/IN resigning/VBG myself/PRP to/TO my/PRP$ fate/NN ,/, and/CC dropping/VBG quietly/RB into/IN the/DT sea/NN ,/, when/WRB my/PRP$ spirits/NNS were/VBD suddenly/RB revived/VBN by/IN hearing/VBG a/DT hollow/JJ voice/NN from/IN above/IN ,/, which/WDT seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB lazily/RB humming/VBG an/DT opera/NN air/NN ./. 
Looking/VBG up/RP ,/, I/PRP perceived/VBD the/DT Angel/NNP of/IN the/DT Odd/NNP ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD leaning/VBG ,/, with/IN his/PRP$ arms/NNS folded/VBD ,/, over/IN the/DT rim/NN of/IN the/DT car/NN ;/: and/CC with/IN a/DT pipe/NN in/IN his/PRP$ mouth/NN ,/, at/IN which/WDT he/PRP puffed/VBD leisurely/RB ,/, seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB upon/JJ excellent/JJ terms/NNS with/IN himself/PRP and/CC the/DT universe/NN ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD too/RB much/JJ exhausted/VBN to/TO speak/VB ,/, so/IN I/PRP merely/RB regarded/VBD him/PRP with/IN an/DT imploring/VBG air/NN ./. 
During/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN a/DT dull/NN ,/, dark/NN ,/, and/CC soundless/JJ day/NN in/IN the/DT autumn/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT clouds/NN hung/NN oppressively/RB low/JJ in/IN the/DT heavens/NNS ,/, I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN passing/VBG alone/RB ,/, on/IN horseback/NN ,/, through/IN a/DT singularly/JJ dreary/JJ tract/NN of/IN country/NN ;/: and/CC at/IN length/NN found/VBD myself/PRP ,/, as/IN the/DT shades/NNS of/IN the/DT evening/NN drew/NN on/IN ,/, within/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT melancholy/JJ House/NNP of/IN Usher/NNP ./. 
I/PRP know/VBP not/RB how/WRB it/PRP was/VBD ;/: but/CC ,/, with/IN the/DT first/JJ glimpse/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN ,/, a/DT sense/NN of/IN insufferable/JJ gloom/NN pervaded/VBD my/PRP$ spirit/NN ./.

I/PRP looked/VBD upon/IN the/DT scene/NN before/IN me—upon/NN the/DT mere/JJ house/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT simple/JJ landscape/NN features/NNS of/IN the/DT domain—upon/NN the/DT bleak/JJ walls—upon/IN the/DT vacant/JJ eye-like/JJ windows—a/NN few/JJ rank/NN sedges—and/NN upon/IN a/DT few/JJ white/JJ trunks/NNS of/IN decayed/NN trees—with/NN an/DT utter/JJ depression/NN of/IN soul/NN which/WDT I/PRP can/MD compare/VB to/TO no/DT earthly/JJ sensation/NN more/RBR properly/RB than/IN to/TO the/DT after-dream/NN of/IN the/DT reveller/NN upon/IN opium—the/JJ bitter/NN lapse/NN into/IN everyday/JJ life—the/VBP hideous/JJ dropping/VBG off/IN of/IN the/DT veil/NN ./. 
There/EX was/VBD an/DT iciness/NN ,/, a/DT sinking/NN ,/, a/DT sickening/NN of/IN the/DT heart—an/NN unredeemed/VBD dreariness/NN of/IN thought/NN which/WDT no/DT goading/NN of/IN the/DT imagination/NN could/MD torture/VB into/IN aught/NN of/IN the/DT sublime/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD possible/JJ ,/, I/PRP reflected/VBD ,/, that/IN a/DT mere/JJ different/JJ arrangement/NN of/IN the/DT particulars/NNS of/IN the/DT scene/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT details/NNS of/IN the/DT picture/NN ,/, would/MD be/VB sufficient/JJ to/TO modify/VB ,/, or/CC perhaps/RB to/TO annihilate/VB its/PRP$ capacity/NN for/IN sorrowful/JJ impression/NN ;/: and/CC ,/, acting/VBG upon/IN this/DT idea/NN ,/, I/PRP reined/VBD my/PRP$ horse/NN to/TO the/DT precipitous/JJ brink/NN of/IN a/DT black/JJ and/CC lurid/JJ tarn/NN [/VBD 3/CD ]/NN that/WDT lay/VBD in/IN unruffled/JJ lustre/NN by/IN the/DT dwelling/NN ,/, and/CC gazed/VBD down—but/NN with/IN a/DT shudder/JJR even/RB more/RBR thrilling/JJ than/IN before—upon/IN the/DT remodelled/JJ and/CC inverted/JJ images/NNS of/IN the/DT gray/JJ sedge/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT ghastly/RB tree/JJ stems/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT vacant/JJ and/CC eye-like/JJ windows/NNS ./.

Such/JJ ,/, I/PRP have/VBP long/RB known/VBN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT paradoxical/JJ law/NN of/IN all/DT sentiments/NNS having/VBG terror/NN as/IN a/DT basis/NN ./. 
And/CC it/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN for/IN this/DT reason/NN only/RB ,/, that/IN ,/, when/WRB I/PRP again/RB uplifted/VBD my/PRP$ eyes/NNS to/TO the/DT house/NN itself/PRP ,/, from/IN its/PRP$ image/NN in/IN the/DT pool/NN ,/, there/EX grew/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ mind/NN a/DT strange/JJ fancy—a/NN fancy/NN so/RB ridiculous/JJ ,/, indeed/RB ,/, that/IN I/PRP but/CC mention/NN it/PRP to/TO show/VB the/DT vivid/JJ force/NN of/IN the/DT sensations/NNS which/WDT oppressed/VBD me/PRP ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD so/RB worked/VBN upon/IN my/PRP$ imagination/NN as/IN really/RB to/TO believe/VB that/IN about/IN the/DT whole/JJ mansion/NN and/CC domain/NN there/RB hung/VBZ an/DT atmosphere/NN peculiar/JJ to/TO themselves/PRP and/CC their/PRP$ immediate/JJ vicinity—an/NNS atmosphere/RB which/WDT had/VBD no/DT affinity/NN with/IN the/DT air/NN of/IN heaven/NN ,/, but/CC which/WDT had/VBD reeked/VBN up/RP from/IN the/DT decayed/NN trees/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT gray/JJ wall/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT silent/JJ tarn—a/NN pestilent/NN and/CC mystic/JJ vapor/NN ,/, dull/NN ,/, sluggish/JJ ,/, faintly/RB discernible/JJ ,/, and/CC leaden-hued/JJ ./. 
Shaking/VBG off/RP from/IN my/PRP$ spirit/NN what/WP must/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT dream/NN ,/, I/PRP scanned/VBD more/RBR narrowly/RB the/DT real/JJ aspect/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT there/EX was/VBD much/JJ that/IN reminded/VBD me/PRP of/IN the/DT specious/JJ totality/NN of/IN old/JJ woodwork/NN which/WDT has/VBZ rotted/VBN for/IN years/NNS in/IN some/DT neglected/JJ vault/NN ,/, with/IN no/DT disturbance/NN from/IN the/DT breath/NN of/IN the/DT external/JJ air/NN ./. 
Beyond/IN this/DT indication/NN of/IN extensive/JJ decay/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, the/DT fabric/NN gave/VBD little/JJ token/NN of/IN instability/NN ./. 
Perhaps/RB the/DT eye/NN of/IN a/DT scrutinizing/VBG observer/NN might/MD have/VB discovered/VBN a/DT barely/RB perceptible/JJ fissure/NN ,/, which/WDT ,/, extending/VBG from/IN the/DT roof/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN in/IN front/NN ,/, made/VBD its/PRP$ way/NN down/IN the/DT wall/NN in/IN a/DT zigzag/JJ direction/NN ,/, until/IN it/PRP became/VBD lost/VBN in/IN the/DT sullen/JJ waters/NNS of/IN the/DT tarn/NN ./. 
Noticing/VBG these/DT things/NNS ,/, I/PRP rode/VBP over/IN a/DT short/JJ causeway/NN to/TO the/DT house/NN ./. 
A/DT servant/NN in/IN waiting/VBG took/VBD my/PRP$ horse/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP entered/VBD the/DT Gothic/NNP archway/NN of/IN the/DT hall/NN ./.

While/IN the/DT objects/NNS around/IN me—while/IN the/DT carvings/NNS of/IN the/DT ceilings/NNS ,/, the/DT sombre/JJ tapestries/NNS of/IN the/DT walls/NNS ,/, the/DT ebon/NN blackness/NN of/IN the/DT floors/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT phantasmagoric/JJ armorial/NN trophies/NNS which/WDT rattled/VBD as/IN I/PRP strode/VBP ,/, were/VBD but/CC matters/NNS to/TO which/WDT ,/, or/CC to/TO such/JJ as/IN which/WDT ,/, I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN accustomed/VBN from/IN my/PRP$ infancy—while/NN I/PRP hesitated/VBD not/RB to/TO acknowledge/VB how/WRB familiar/JJ was/VBD all/DT this—I/NN still/RB wondered/VBD to/TO find/VB how/WRB unfamiliar/JJ were/VBD the/DT fancies/NNS which/WDT ordinary/JJ images/NNS were/VBD stirring/VBG up/RP ./. 
On/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT staircases/NNS I/PRP met/VBD the/DT physician/NN of/IN the/DT family/NN ./.

The/DT valet/NN now/RB threw/VBZ open/RP a/DT door/NN and/CC ushered/JJ me/PRP into/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN his/PRP$ master/NN ./. 
The/DT room/NN in/IN which/WDT I/PRP found/VBD myself/PRP was/VBD very/RB large/JJ and/CC lofty/JJ ./.

The/DT general/JJ furniture/NN was/VBD profuse/RB ,/, comfortless/NN ,/, antique/NN ,/, and/CC tattered/VBD ./. 
Many/JJ books/NNS and/CC musical/JJ instruments/NNS lay/VBD scattered/VBN about/IN ,/, but/CC failed/VBD to/TO give/VB any/DT vitality/NN to/TO the/DT scene/NN ./. 
I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN I/PRP breathed/VBD an/DT atmosphere/NN of/IN sorrow/NN ./. 
An/DT air/NN of/IN stern/JJ ,/, deep/JJ ,/, and/CC irredeemable/JJ gloom/NN hung/NN over/IN and/CC pervaded/VBD all/DT ./. 
Upon/IN my/PRP$ entrance/NN ,/, Usher/NNP arose/VBD from/IN a/DT sofa/NN on/IN which/WDT he/PRP had/VBD been/VBN lying/VBG at/IN full/JJ length/NN ,/, and/CC greeted/VBD me/PRP with/IN ,/, a/DT vivacious/JJ warmth/NN which/WDT had/VBD much/RB in/IN it/PRP ,/, I/PRP at/IN first/JJ thought/NN ,/, of/IN an/DT overdone/NN cordiality—of/VBD the/DT constrained/JJ effort/NN of/IN the/DT ennuyé/JJ man/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN ./. 
A/DT glance/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, at/IN his/PRP$ countenance/NN convinced/VBD me/PRP of/IN his/PRP$ perfect/JJ sincerity/NN ./. 
We/PRP sat/VBD down/RB ;/: and/CC for/IN some/DT moments/NNS ,/, while/IN he/PRP spoke/VBD not/RB ./.

Surely/RB ,/, man/NN had/VBD never/RB before/RB so/RB terribly/RB altered/VBN ,/, in/IN so/RB brief/JJ a/DT period/NN ,/, as/IN had/VBD Roderick/NNP Usher/NNP !/.

A/DT cadaverousness/NN of/IN complexion/NN ;/: an/DT eye/NN large/JJ ,/, liquid/JJ ,/, and/CC luminous/JJ beyond/IN comparison/NN ;/: lips/VBZ somewhat/RB thin/JJ and/CC very/RB pallid/JJ ,/, but/CC of/IN a/DT surpassingly/RB beautiful/JJ curve/NN ;/: a/DT nose/NN of/IN a/DT delicate/JJ Hebrew/NNP model/NN ,/, but/CC with/IN a/DT breadth/NN of/IN nostril/JJ unusual/JJ in/IN similar/JJ formations/NNS ;/: a/DT finely/RB moulded/VBN chin/NN ,/, speaking/NN ,/, in/IN its/PRP$ want/NN of/IN prominence/NN ,/, of/IN a/DT want/NN of/IN moral/JJ energy/NN ;/: hair/NN of/IN a/DT more/JJR than/IN web-like/JJ softness/NN and/CC tenuity/NN ;/: these/DT features/NNS ,/, with/IN an/DT inordinate/JJ expansion/NN above/IN the/DT regions/NNS of/IN the/DT temple/NN ,/, made/VBD up/RP altogether/RB a/DT countenance/NN not/RB easily/RB to/TO be/VB forgotten/VBN ./. 
And/CC now/RB in/IN the/DT mere/JJ exaggeration/NN of/IN the/DT prevailing/JJ character/NN of/IN these/DT features/NNS ,/, and/CC of/IN the/DT expression/NN they/PRP were/VBD wont/VBN to/TO convey/VB ,/, lay/VB so/RB much/JJ of/IN change/NN that/IN I/PRP doubted/VBD to/TO whom/WP I/PRP spoke/VBD ./. 
The/DT now/RB ghastly/RB pallor/NN of/IN the/DT skin/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT now/RB miraculous/JJ lustre/NN of/IN the/DT eye/NN ,/, above/IN all/DT things/NNS startled/VBN ,/, and/CC even/RB awed/VBD me/PRP ./. 
The/DT silken/JJ hair/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, had/VBD been/VBN suffered/VBN to/TO grow/VB all/DT unheeded/JJ ,/, and/CC as/IN ,/, in/IN its/PRP$ wild/JJ gossamer/NN texture/NN ,/, it/PRP floated/VBD rather/RB than/IN fell/VBD about/IN the/DT face/NN ,/, I/PRP could/MD not/RB ,/, even/RB with/IN effort/NN ,/, connect/VB its/PRP$ arabesque/JJ expression/NN with/IN any/DT idea/NN of/IN simple/JJ humanity/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT manner/NN of/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN I/PRP was/VBD at/IN once/RB struck/VBN with/IN an/DT incoherence—an/JJ inconsistency/NN ;/: and/CC I/PRP soon/RB found/VBD this/DT to/TO arise/VB from/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN feeble/JJ and/CC futile/JJ struggles/NNS to/TO overcome/VB an/DT habitual/JJ trepidancy/NN ,/, an/DT excessive/JJ nervous/JJ agitation/NN ./. 
For/IN something/NN of/IN this/DT nature/NN I/PRP had/VBD indeed/RB been/VBN prepared/VBN ,/, no/DT less/NN by/IN his/PRP$ letter/NN than/IN by/IN reminiscences/NNS of/IN certain/JJ boyish/JJ traits/NNS ,/, and/CC by/IN conclusions/NNS deduced/VBN from/IN his/PRP$ peculiar/JJ physical/JJ conformation/NN and/CC temperament/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ action/NN was/VBD alternately/RB vivacious/JJ and/CC sullen/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ voice/NN varied/VBD rapidly/RB from/IN a/DT tremulous/JJ indecision/NN (/( when/WRB the/DT animal/JJ spirits/NNS seemed/VBD utterly/RB in/IN abeyance/NN )/) to/TO that/DT species/NNS of/IN energetic/JJ concision—that/NN abrupt/NN ,/, weighty/NN ,/, unhurried/JJ ,/, and/CC hollow-sounding/NN enunciation—that/DT leaden/JJ ,/, self-balanced/JJ ,/, and/CC perfectly/RB modulated/VBN guttural/JJ utterance/NN ,/, which/WDT may/MD be/VB observed/VBN in/IN the/DT lost/JJ drunkard/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT irreclaimable/JJ eater/NN of/IN opium/NN ,/, during/IN the/DT periods/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ most/JJS intense/JJ excitement/NN ./.

With/IN the/DT increase/NN of/IN the/DT chronic/JJ disease/NN which/WDT had/VBD thus/RB ,/, apparently/RB ,/, taken/VBN too/RB sure/JJ hold/VBP upon/IN her/PRP$ constitution/NN to/TO be/VB eradicated/VBN by/IN human/JJ means/NNS ,/, I/PRP could/MD not/RB fail/VB to/TO observe/VB a/DT similar/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT nervous/JJ irritation/NN of/IN her/PRP$ temperament/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN her/PRP$ excitability/NN by/IN trivial/JJ causes/NNS of/IN fear/NN ./. 
She/PRP spoke/VBD again/RB ,/, and/CC now/RB more/RBR frequently/RB and/CC pertinaciously/RB ,/, of/IN the/DT sounds/NNS —/NN of/IN the/DT slight/JJ sounds/NNS —/JJ and/CC of/IN the/DT unusual/JJ motions/NNS among/IN the/DT tapestries/NNS ,/, to/TO which/WDT she/PRP had/VBD formerly/RB alluded/VBN ./. 
One/CD night/NN ,/, near/IN the/DT closing/NN in/IN of/IN September/NNP ,/, she/PRP pressed/VBD this/DT distressing/VBG subject/JJ with/IN more/JJR than/IN usual/JJ emphasis/NN upon/IN my/PRP$ attention/NN ./. 
She/PRP had/VBD just/RB awakened/VBN from/IN an/DT unquiet/JJ slumber/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN watching/VBG ,/, with/IN feelings/NNS half/NN of/IN anxiety/NN ,/, half/NN of/IN vague/JJ terror/NN ,/, the/DT workings/NNS of/IN her/PRP$ emaciated/JJ countenance/NN ./. 
I/PRP sat/VBP by/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN her/PRP$ ebony/NN bed/NN ,/, upon/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT ottomans/NNS of/IN India/NNP ./. 
She/PRP partly/RB arose/VBD ,/, and/CC spoke/VBD ,/, in/IN an/DT earnest/NN low/JJ whisper/NN ,/, of/IN sounds/NNS which/WDT she/PRP then/RB heard/VBD ,/, but/CC which/WDT I/PRP could/MD not/RB hear/VB —/NN of/IN motions/NNS which/WDT she/PRP then/RB saw/VBD ,/, but/CC which/WDT I/PRP could/MD not/RB perceive/VB ./. 
The/DT wind/NN was/VBD rushing/VBG hurriedly/RB behind/IN the/DT tapestries/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP wished/VBD to/TO show/VB her/PRP$ (/( what/WP ,/, let/VB me/PRP confess/VB it/PRP ,/, I/PRP could/MD not/RB all/DT believe/VBP )/) that/IN those/DT almost/RB inarticulate/JJ breathings/NNS ,/, and/CC those/DT very/RB gentle/JJ variations/NNS of/IN the/DT figures/NNS upon/IN the/DT wall/NN ,/, were/VBD but/CC the/DT natural/JJ effects/NNS of/IN that/DT customary/JJ rushing/NN of/IN the/DT wind/NN ./. 
But/CC a/DT deadly/JJ pallor/NN ,/, overspreading/VBG her/PRP$ face/NN ,/, had/VBD proved/VBN to/TO me/PRP that/IN my/PRP$ exertions/NNS to/TO reassure/VB her/PRP$ would/MD be/VB fruitless/JJ ./. 
She/PRP appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB fainting/JJ ,/, and/CC no/DT attendants/NNS were/VBD within/IN call/NN ./. 
I/PRP remembered/VBD where/WRB was/VBD deposited/VBN a/DT decanter/NN of/IN light/JJ wine/NN which/WDT had/VBD been/VBN ordered/VBN by/IN her/PRP$ physicians/NNS ,/, and/CC hastened/VBD across/IN the/DT chamber/NN to/TO procure/VB it/PRP ./. 
But/CC ,/, as/IN I/PRP stepped/VBD beneath/IN the/DT light/NN of/IN the/DT censer/NN ,/, two/CD circumstances/NNS of/IN a/DT startling/JJ nature/NN attracted/VBD my/PRP$ attention/NN ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD felt/VBN that/IN some/DT palpable/JJ although/IN invisible/JJ object/NN had/VBD passed/VBN lightly/RB by/IN my/PRP$ person/NN ;/: and/CC I/PRP saw/VBD that/IN there/EX lay/VB upon/IN the/DT golden/JJ carpet/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT very/RB middle/JJ of/IN the/DT rich/JJ lustre/NN thrown/VBN from/IN the/DT censer/NN ,/, a/DT shadow/NN —/VBZ a/DT faint/NN ,/, indefinite/JJ shadow/NN of/IN angelic/JJ aspect/JJ —/NN such/JJ as/IN might/MD be/VB fancied/VBN for/IN the/DT shadow/NN of/IN a/DT shade/NN ./. 
But/CC I/PRP was/VBD wild/JJ with/IN the/DT excitement/NN of/IN an/DT immoderate/NN dose/NN of/IN opium/NN ,/, and/CC heeded/VBD these/DT things/NNS but/CC little/JJ ,/, nor/CC spoke/NN of/IN them/PRP to/TO Rowena/NNP ./. 
Having/VBG found/VBN the/DT wine/NN ,/, I/PRP recrossed/VBD the/DT chamber/NN ,/, and/CC poured/VBD out/RP a/DT gobletful/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP held/VBD to/TO the/DT lips/NNS of/IN the/DT fainting/NN lady/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD then/RB that/IN I/PRP became/VBD distinctly/RB aware/JJ of/IN a/DT gentle/JJ foot-fall/JJ upon/IN the/DT carpet/NN ,/, and/CC near/IN the/DT couch/NN ;/: and/CC in/IN a/DT second/JJ thereafter/NN ,/, as/IN Rowena/NNP was/VBD in/IN the/DT act/NN of/IN raising/VBG the/DT wine/NN to/TO her/PRP$ lips/NNS ,/, I/PRP saw/VBD ,/, or/CC may/MD have/VB dreamed/VBN that/IN I/PRP saw/VBD ,/, fall/NN within/IN the/DT goblet/NN ,/, as/IN if/IN from/IN some/DT invisible/JJ spring/NN in/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN of/IN the/DT room/NN ,/, three/CD or/CC four/CD large/JJ drops/NNS of/IN a/DT brilliant/NN and/CC ruby/NN colored/VBD fluid/NN ./. 
If/IN this/DT I/PRP saw/VBD —/NNP not/RB so/RB Rowena/NNP ./. 
She/PRP swallowed/VBD the/DT wine/NN unhesitatingly/RB ,/, and/CC I/PRP forbore/VBP to/TO speak/VB to/TO her/PRP$ of/IN a/DT circumstance/NN which/WDT must/MD ,/, after/IN all/DT ,/, I/PRP considered/VBD ,/, have/VBP been/VBN but/CC the/DT suggestion/NN of/IN a/DT vivid/JJ imagination/NN ,/, rendered/VBD morbidly/RB active/JJ by/IN the/DT terror/NN of/IN the/DT lady/NN ,/, by/IN the/DT opium/NN ,/, and/CC by/IN the/DT hour/NN ./. 
It/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN midnight/VBN ,/, or/CC perhaps/RB earlier/RBR ,/, or/CC later/RB ,/, for/IN I/PRP had/VBD taken/VBN no/DT note/NN of/IN time/NN ,/, when/WRB a/DT sob/NN ,/, low/JJ ,/, gentle/JJ ,/, but/CC very/RB distinct/JJ ,/, startled/VBD me/PRP from/IN my/PRP$ revery/NN ./. 
I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN it/PRP came/VBD from/IN the/DT bed/NN of/IN ebony/NN —/VBP the/DT bed/NN of/IN death/NN ./. 
I/PRP listened/VBD in/IN an/DT agony/NN of/IN superstitious/JJ terror/NN —/NN but/CC there/EX was/VBD no/DT repetition/NN of/IN the/DT sound/NN ./. 
I/PRP strained/VBD my/PRP$ vision/NN to/TO detect/VB any/DT motion/NN in/IN the/DT corpse/NN —/NN but/CC there/EX was/VBD not/RB the/DT slightest/JJS perceptible/NN ./. 
Yet/CC I/PRP could/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN deceived/VBN ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD heard/VBN the/DT noise/NN ,/, however/RB faint/NN ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ soul/NN was/VBD awakened/VBN within/IN me/PRP ./. 
I/PRP resolutely/RB and/CC perseveringly/RB kept/VB my/PRP$ attention/NN riveted/VBD upon/IN the/DT body/NN ./. 
Many/JJ minutes/NNS elapsed/VBD before/IN any/DT circumstance/NN occurred/VBD tending/VBG to/TO throw/VB light/JJ upon/IN the/DT mystery/NN ./. 
At/IN length/RBS it/PRP became/VBD evident/JJ that/IN a/DT slight/NN ,/, a/DT very/RB feeble/JJ ,/, and/CC barely/RB noticeable/JJ tinge/NN of/IN color/NN had/VBD flushed/VBN up/RP within/IN the/DT cheeks/NN ,/, and/CC along/IN the/DT sunken/NN small/JJ veins/NNS of/IN the/DT eyelids/NNS ./. 
Through/IN a/DT species/NNS of/IN unutterable/JJ horror/NN and/CC awe/NN ,/, for/IN which/WDT the/DT language/NN of/IN mortality/NN has/VBZ no/DT sufficiently/RB energetic/JJ expression/NN ,/, I/PRP felt/VBD my/PRP$ heart/NN cease/NN to/TO beat/VB ,/, my/PRP$ limbs/JJ grow/NN rigid/JJ where/WRB I/PRP sat/VBD ./. 
Yet/CC a/DT sense/NN of/IN duty/NN finally/RB operated/VBD to/TO restore/VB my/PRP$ self-possession/NN ./. 
I/PRP could/MD no/RB longer/RBR doubt/VB that/IN we/PRP had/VBD been/VBN precipitate/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ preparations/NNS —/VBP that/IN Rowena/NNP still/RB lived/VBD ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD necessary/JJ that/IN some/DT immediate/JJ exertion/NN be/VB made/VBN ;/: yet/CC the/DT turret/NN was/VBD altogether/RB apart/RB from/IN the/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT abbey/NN tenanted/VBN by/IN the/DT servants/NNS —/VBP there/EX were/VBD none/NN within/IN call/NN —/NN I/PRP had/VBD no/DT means/NNS of/IN summoning/VBG them/PRP to/TO my/PRP$ aid/NN without/IN leaving/VBG the/DT room/NN for/IN many/JJ minutes/NNS —/VBP and/CC this/DT I/PRP could/MD not/RB venture/NN to/TO do/VB ./. 
I/PRP therefore/RB struggled/VBD alone/RB in/IN my/PRP$ endeavors/NNS to/TO call/VB back/RB the/DT spirit/NN still/RB hovering/VBG ./. 
In/IN a/DT short/JJ period/NN it/PRP was/VBD certain/JJ ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN a/DT relapse/NN had/VBD taken/VBN place/NN ;/: the/DT color/NN disappeared/VBD from/IN both/DT eyelid/JJ and/CC cheek/JJ ,/, leaving/VBG a/DT wanness/NN even/RB more/RBR than/IN that/DT of/IN marble/NN ;/: the/DT lips/NNS became/VBD doubly/RB shrivelled/VBN and/CC pinched/VBN up/RP in/IN the/DT ghastly/JJ expression/NN of/IN death/NN ;/: a/DT repulsive/JJ clamminess/NN and/CC coldness/NN overspread/VBP rapidly/RB the/DT surface/NN of/IN the/DT body/NN ;/: and/CC all/PDT the/DT usual/JJ rigorous/JJ stiffness/NN immediately/RB supervened/VBD ./. 
I/PRP fell/VBD back/RB with/IN a/DT shudder/NN upon/IN the/DT couch/NN from/IN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN so/RB startlingly/RB aroused/VBN ,/, and/CC again/RB gave/VBD myself/PRP up/RP to/TO passionate/VB waking/JJ visions/NNS of/IN Ligeia/NNP ./. 
An/DT hour/NN thus/RB elapsed/VBD when/WRB (/( could/MD it/PRP be/VB possible/JJ ?/. )/) 
I/PRP was/VBD a/DT second/JJ time/NN aware/NN of/IN some/DT vague/JJ sound/NN issuing/VBG from/IN the/DT region/NN of/IN the/DT bed/NN ./. 
I/PRP listened/VBD —/NNP in/IN extremity/NN of/IN horror/NN ./. 
The/DT sound/NN came/VBD again/RB —/JJ it/PRP was/VBD a/DT sigh/NN ./. 
Rushing/VBG to/TO the/DT corpse/NN ,/, I/PRP saw/VBD —/NNP distinctly/RB saw/VBD —/PRP a/DT tremor/NN upon/IN the/DT lips/NNS ./. 
In/IN a/DT minute/NN afterward/IN they/PRP relaxed/VBP ,/, disclosing/VBG a/DT bright/JJ line/NN of/IN the/DT pearly/JJ teeth/NN ./. 
Amazement/NN now/RB struggled/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ bosom/NN with/IN the/DT profound/NN awe/NN which/WDT had/VBD hitherto/NN reigned/VBN there/RB alone/RB ./. 
I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN my/PRP$ vision/NN grew/VBD dim/NN ,/, that/IN my/PRP$ reason/NN wandered/VBD ;/: and/CC it/PRP was/VBD only/RB by/IN a/DT violent/JJ effort/NN that/IN I/PRP at/IN length/NN succeeded/VBN in/IN nerving/VBG myself/PRP to/TO the/DT task/NN which/WDT duty/NN thus/RB once/RB more/JJR had/VBD pointed/VBN out/RP ./. 
There/EX was/VBD now/RB a/DT partial/JJ glow/NN upon/IN the/DT forehead/NN and/CC upon/IN the/DT cheek/NN and/CC throat/NN ;/: a/DT perceptible/JJ warmth/NN pervaded/VBD the/DT whole/JJ frame/NN ;/: there/EX was/VBD even/RB a/DT slight/JJ pulsation/NN at/IN the/DT heart/NN ./. 
The/DT lady/NN lived/VBD ;/: and/CC with/IN redoubled/JJ ardor/NN I/PRP betook/VBP myself/PRP to/TO the/DT task/NN of/IN restoration/NN ./. 
I/PRP chafed/VBP and/CC bathed/VBD the/DT temples/NNS and/CC the/DT hands/NNS ,/, and/CC used/VBD every/DT exertion/NN which/WDT experience/NN ,/, and/CC no/DT little/JJ medical/JJ reading/NN ,/, could/MD suggest/VB ./. 
But/CC in/IN vain/NN ./. 
Suddenly/RB ,/, the/DT color/NN fled/VBD ,/, the/DT pulsation/NN ceased/VBD ,/, the/DT lips/NNS resumed/VBD the/DT expression/NN of/IN the/DT dead/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, in/IN an/DT instant/JJ afterward/NN ,/, the/DT whole/JJ body/NN took/VBD upon/IN itself/PRP the/DT icy/NN chilliness/NN ,/, the/DT livid/NN hue/NN ,/, the/DT intense/JJ rigidity/NN ,/, the/DT sunken/JJ outline/NN ,/, and/CC all/PDT the/DT loathsome/JJ peculiarities/NNS of/IN that/DT which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN ,/, for/IN many/JJ days/NNS ,/, a/DT tenant/NN of/IN the/DT tomb/NN ./. 
And/CC again/RB I/PRP sunk/VBP into/IN visions/NNS of/IN Ligeia/NNP —/NNP and/CC again/RB ,/, (/( what/WP marvel/VBP that/IN I/PRP shudder/VBP while/IN I/PRP write/VBP ?/. )/)

But/CC why/WRB shall/MD I/PRP minutely/RB detail/VBP the/DT unspeakable/JJ horrors/NNS of/IN that/DT night/NN ?/.

Let/VB me/PRP hurry/VB to/TO a/DT conclusion/NN ./. 
The/DT greater/JJR part/NN of/IN the/DT fearful/JJ night/NN had/VBD worn/VBN away/RB ,/, and/CC she/PRP who/WP had/VBD been/VBN dead/JJ ,/, once/RB again/RB stirred/JJ —/NNS and/CC now/RB more/RBR vigorously/RB than/IN hitherto/NN ,/, although/IN arousing/VBG from/IN a/DT dissolution/NN more/RBR appalling/JJ in/IN its/PRP$ utter/NN hopelessness/NN than/IN any/DT ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD long/RB ceased/VBN to/TO struggle/VB or/CC to/TO move/VB ,/, and/CC remained/VBD sitting/VBG rigidly/RB upon/IN the/DT ottoman/NN ,/, a/DT helpless/JJ prey/NN to/TO a/DT whirl/NN of/IN violent/JJ emotions/NNS ,/, of/IN which/WDT extreme/JJ awe/NN was/VBD perhaps/RB the/DT least/JJS terrible/JJ ,/, the/DT least/JJS consuming/NN ./. 
The/DT corpse/NN ,/, I/PRP repeat/VBP ,/, stirred/VBD ,/, and/CC now/RB more/RBR vigorously/RB than/IN before/RB ./. 
The/DT hues/NNS of/IN life/NN flushed/VBN up/RP with/IN unwonted/JJ energy/NN into/IN the/DT countenance/NN —/VBD the/DT limbs/NNS relaxed/VBD —/NNP and/CC ,/, save/VBP that/IN the/DT eyelids/NNS were/VBD yet/RB pressed/VBN heavily/RB together/RB ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT bandages/NNS and/CC draperies/NNS of/IN the/DT grave/NN still/RB imparted/VBD their/PRP$ charnel/NNS character/NN to/TO the/DT figure/NN ,/, I/PRP might/MD have/VB dreamed/VBN that/IN Rowena/NNP had/VBD indeed/RB shaken/VBN off/RP ,/, utterly/RB ,/, the/DT fetters/NNS of/IN Death/NNP ./. 
But/CC if/IN this/DT idea/NN was/VBD not/RB ,/, even/RB then/RB ,/, altogether/RB adopted/VBN ,/, I/PRP could/MD at/IN least/JJS doubt/NN no/DT longer/RB ,/, when/WRB ,/, arising/VBG from/IN the/DT bed/NN ,/, tottering/VBG ,/, with/IN feeble/JJ steps/NNS ,/, with/IN closed/JJ eyes/NNS ,/, and/CC with/IN the/DT manner/NN of/IN one/CD bewildered/VBN in/IN a/DT dream/NN ,/, the/DT thing/NN that/WDT was/VBD enshrouded/VBN advanced/JJ boldly/RB [/VBP [/JJ bodily/RB ]/NNP ]/NNP and/CC palpably/RB into/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN the/DT apartment/NN ./.

Next/JJ moment/NN the/DT luggage/NN ,/, the/DT seat/NN ,/, the/DT platform/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT station/NN had/VBD completely/RB vanished/VBN ./. 
The/DT four/CD children/NNS ,/, holding/VBG hands/NNS and/CC panting/NN ,/, found/VBN themselves/PRP standing/VBG in/IN a/DT woody/NN place—such/PDT a/DT woody/NN place/NN that/WDT branches/NNS were/VBD sticking/VBG into/IN them/PRP and/CC there/EX was/VBD hardly/RB room/NN to/TO move/VB ./.

The/DT children/NNS 's/POS feet/NNS ,/, after/IN the/DT change/NN from/IN the/DT cool/JJ water/NN ,/, felt/VBD hot/JJ and/CC heavy/JJ ./. 
Susan/NNP and/CC Lucy/NNP had/VBD raincoats/NNS to/TO carry/VB ./.

They/PRP knew/VBD that/IN the/DT stream/NN would/MD be/VB better/JJR to/TO drink/VB farther/JJR up/RB ,/, away/RB from/IN the/DT beach/NN ,/, so/IN they/PRP went/VBD at/IN once/RB to/TO the/DT spot/NN where/WRB it/PRP came/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT wood/NN ./.

They/PRP dropped/VBD on/IN their/PRP$ knees/NNS by/IN the/DT first/JJ brown/NN ,/, dimply/VB pool/NN and/CC drank/NN and/CC drank/NN ,/, and/CC dipped/VBD their/PRP$ faces/VBZ in/IN the/DT water/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB dipped/VBD their/PRP$ arms/NNS in/IN up/IN to/TO the/DT elbow/NN ./.

Now/RB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT shrunken/JJ miser/NN ,/, hoarding/VBG its/PRP$ resources/NNS as/IN if/IN trying/VBG to/TO make/VB amends/NNS for/IN its/PRP$ prodigal/JJ youth/NN ./. 
No/DT one/CD seriously/RB expected/VBN to/TO find/VB planets/NNS ./. 
If/IN there/EX had/VBD been/VBN any/DT before/IN the/DT explosion/NN ,/, they/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN boiled/VBN into/IN puffs/NNS of/IN vapor/NN ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ substance/NN lost/VBN in/IN the/DT greater/JJR wreckage/NN of/IN the/DT star/NN itself/PRP ./. 
But/CC we/PRP made/VBD the/DT automatic/JJ search/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP always/RB do/VBP when/WRB approaching/VBG an/DT unknown/JJ sun/NN ,/, and/CC presently/RB we/PRP found/VBD a/DT single/JJ small/JJ world/NN circling/VBG the/DT star/NN at/IN an/DT immense/JJ distance/NN ./. 
It/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN the/DT Pluto/NNP of/IN this/DT vanished/VBN Solar/NNP System/NNP ,/, orbiting/VBG on/IN the/DT frontiers/NNS of/IN the/DT night/NN ./. 
Too/RB far/RB from/IN the/DT central/JJ sun/NN ever/RB to/TO have/VB known/VBN life/NN ,/, its/PRP$ remoteness/NN had/VBD saved/VBN it/PRP from/IN the/DT fate/NN of/IN all/DT its/PRP$ lost/VBN companions/NNS ./. 
The/DT passing/NN fires/NNS had/VBD seared/VBN its/PRP$ rocks/NNS and/CC burned/VBD away/RP the/DT mantle/NN of/IN frozen/JJ gas/NN that/WDT must/MD have/VB covered/VBN it/PRP in/IN the/DT days/NNS before/IN the/DT disaster/NN ./. 
We/PRP landed/VBD ,/, and/CC we/PRP found/VBD the/DT Vault/NNP ./. 
Its/PRP$ builders/NNS had/VBD made/VBN sure/JJ that/IN we/PRP should/MD ./. 
The/DT monolithic/JJ marker/NN that/WDT stood/VBD above/IN the/DT entrance/NN was/VBD now/RB a/DT fused/JJ stump/NN ,/, but/CC even/RB the/DT first/JJ long-range/NN photographs/NN told/VBD us/PRP that/IN here/RB was/VBD the/DT work/NN of/IN intelligence/NN ./. 
A/DT little/JJ later/RBR we/PRP detected/VBD the/DT continent-wide/JJ pattern/NN of/IN radioactivity/NN that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN buried/VBN in/IN the/DT rock/NN ./. 
Even/RB if/IN the/DT pylon/NN above/IN the/DT Vault/NNP had/VBD been/VBN destroyed/VBN ,/, this/DT would/MD have/VB remained/VBN ,/, an/DT immovable/JJ and/CC all-but/JJ eternal/JJ beacon/NN calling/VBG to/TO the/DT stars/NNS ./. 
Our/PRP$ ship/NN fell/VBD toward/IN this/DT gigantic/JJ bull/NN ’/NNP s/VBZ eye/NN like/IN an/DT arrow/NN into/IN its/PRP$ target/NN ./. 
The/DT pylon/NN must/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT mile/JJ high/NN when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD built/VBN ,/, but/CC now/RB it/PRP looked/VBD like/IN a/DT candle/NN that/WDT had/VBD melted/VBN down/RP into/IN a/DT puddle/NN of/IN wax/NN ./. 
It/PRP took/VBD us/PRP a/DT week/NN to/TO drill/VB through/IN the/DT fused/JJ rock/NN ,/, since/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB the/DT proper/JJ tools/NNS for/IN a/DT task/NN like/IN this/DT ./. 
We/PRP were/VBD astronomers/NNS ,/, not/RB archaeologists/NNS ,/, but/CC we/PRP could/MD improvise/VB ./. 
Our/PRP$ original/JJ purpose/NN was/VBD forgotten/VBN :/: this/DT lonely/JJ monument/NN ,/, reared/VBN with/IN such/JJ labor/NN at/IN the/DT greatest/JJS possible/JJ distance/NN from/IN the/DT doomed/VBN sun/NN ,/, could/MD have/VB only/RB one/CD meaning/NN ./. 
A/DT civilization/NN that/WDT knew/VBD it/PRP was/VBD about/IN to/TO die/VB had/VBD made/VBN its/PRP$ last/JJ bid/NN for/IN immortality/NN ./. 
It/PRP will/MD take/VB us/PRP generations/NNS to/TO examine/VB all/PDT the/DT treasures/NNS that/WDT were/VBD placed/VBN in/IN the/DT Vault/NNP ./. 
They/PRP had/VBD plenty/NN of/IN time/NN to/TO prepare/VB ,/, for/IN their/PRP$ sun/NN must/MD have/VB given/VBN its/PRP$ first/JJ warnings/NNS many/JJ years/NNS before/IN the/DT final/JJ detonation/NN ./. 
Everything/VBG that/IN they/PRP wished/VBD to/TO preserve/VB ,/, all/PDT the/DT fruits/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ genius/NN ,/, they/PRP brought/VBD here/RB to/TO this/DT distant/JJ world/NN in/IN the/DT days/NNS before/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, hoping/VBG that/IN some/DT other/JJ race/NN would/MD find/VB it/PRP and/CC that/IN they/PRP would/MD not/RB be/VB utterly/RB forgotten/VBN ./. 
Would/MD we/PRP have/VB done/VBN as/RB well/RB ,/, or/CC would/MD we/PRP have/VB been/VBN too/RB lost/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ misery/NN to/TO give/VB thought/NN to/TO a/DT future/NN we/PRP could/MD never/RB see/VB or/CC share/NN ?/. 
If/IN only/RB they/PRP had/VBD had/VBN a/DT little/RB more/JJR time/NN !/. 
They/PRP could/MD travel/VB freely/RB enough/RB between/IN the/DT planets/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ sun/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP had/VBD not/RB yet/RB learned/VBN to/TO cross/VB the/DT interstellar/JJ gulfs/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT nearest/JJS Solar/JJ System/NN was/VBD a/DT hundred/JJ light-years/JJ away/RB ./. 
Yet/RB even/RB had/VBD they/PRP possessed/VBD the/DT secret/NN of/IN the/DT Transfinite/NNP Drive/NNP ,/, no/RB more/JJR than/IN a/DT few/JJ millions/NNS could/MD have/VB been/VBN saved/VBN ./. 
Perhaps/RB it/PRP was/VBD better/RBR thus/RB ./. 
Even/RB if/IN they/PRP had/VBD not/RB been/VBN so/RB disturbingly/RB human/JJ as/IN their/PRP$ sculpture/NN shows/NNS ,/, we/PRP could/MD not/RB have/VB helped/VBN admiring/VBG them/PRP and/CC grieving/VBG for/IN their/PRP$ fate/NN ./. 
They/PRP left/VBD thousands/NNS of/IN visual/JJ records/NNS and/CC the/DT machines/NNS for/IN projecting/VBG them/PRP ,/, together/RB with/IN elaborate/JJ pictorial/JJ instructions/NNS from/IN which/WDT it/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO learn/VB their/PRP$ written/VBN language/NN ./. 
We/PRP have/VBP examined/VBN many/JJ of/IN these/DT records/NNS ,/, and/CC brought/VBD to/TO life/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN in/IN six/CD thousand/CD years/NNS the/DT warmth/NN and/CC beauty/NN of/IN a/DT civilization/NN that/IN in/IN many/JJ ways/NNS must/MD have/VB been/VBN superior/JJ to/TO our/PRP$ own/JJ ./. 
Perhaps/RB they/PRP only/RB showed/VBD us/PRP the/DT best/JJS ,/, and/CC one/CD can/MD hardly/RB blame/VB them/PRP ./. 
But/CC their/PRP$ worlds/NNS were/VBD very/RB lovely/RB ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ cities/NNS were/VBD built/VBN with/IN a/DT grace/NN that/WDT matches/VBZ anything/NN of/IN man/NN ’/NNP s/NN ./. 
We/PRP have/VBP watched/VBN them/PRP at/IN work/NN and/CC play/NN ,/, and/CC listened/VBD to/TO their/PRP$ musical/JJ speech/NN sounding/VBG across/IN the/DT centuries/NNS ./.

Curious/JJ whip/NN like/IN trees/NNS line/NN the/DT shore/NN ,/, and/CC some/DT very/RB large/JJ animal/NN is/VBZ wading/VBG in/IN the/DT shallows/NNS ,/, yet/RB attracting/VBG no/DT attention/NN at/IN all/DT ./. 
And/CC sinking/VBG into/IN the/DT sea/NN ,/, still/RB warm/JJ and/CC friendly/JJ and/CC life-giving/JJ ,/, is/VBZ the/DT sun/NN that/WDT will/MD soon/RB turn/VB traitor/NN and/CC obliterate/VB all/DT this/DT innocent/JJ happiness/NN ./. 
Perhaps/RB if/IN we/PRP had/VBD not/RB been/VBN so/RB far/RB from/IN home/NN and/CC so/RB vulnerable/JJ to/TO loneliness/VB ,/, we/PRP should/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN so/RB deeply/RB moved/VBN ./. 
Many/JJ of/IN us/PRP had/VBD seen/VBN the/DT ruins/NNS of/IN ancient/JJ civilizations/NNS on/IN other/JJ worlds/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP had/VBD never/RB affected/VBN us/PRP so/RB profoundly/RB ./. 
This/DT tragedy/NN was/VBD unique/JJ ./. 
It/PRP is/VBZ one/CD thing/NN for/IN a/DT race/NN to/TO fail/VB and/CC die/VB ,/, as/IN nations/NNS and/CC cultures/NNS have/VBP done/VBN on/IN Earth/NN ./.

My/PRP$ colleagues/NNS have/VBP asked/VBN me/PRP that/IN ,/, and/CC I/PRP have/VBP given/VBN what/WP answers/VBZ I/PRP can/MD ./. 
Perhaps/RB you/PRP could/MD have/VB done/VBN better/RBR ,/, Father/NNP Loyola/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP found/VBN nothing/NN in/IN the/DT Exercitia/NNP Spiritualia/NNP that/WDT helps/VBZ me/PRP here/RB ./. 
They/PRP were/VBD not/RB an/DT evil/JJ people/NNS :/: I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB what/WP gods/NNS they/PRP worshiped/VBD ,/, if/IN indeed/RB they/PRP worshiped/VBD any/DT ./.

They/PRP could/MD have/VB taught/VBN us/PRP much/JJ :/: why/WRB were/VBD they/PRP destroyed/VBD ?/. 
I/PRP know/VBP the/DT answers/NNS that/WDT my/PRP$ colleagues/NNS will/MD give/VB when/WRB they/PRP get/VBP back/RB to/TO Earth/NNP ./.

Whether/IN that/DT race/NN has/VBZ done/VBN good/JJ or/CC evil/JJ during/IN its/PRP$ lifetime/NN will/MD make/VB no/DT difference/NN in/IN the/DT end/NN :/: there/EX is/VBZ no/DT divine/JJ justice/NN ,/, for/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT God/NNP ./. 
Yet/RB ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, what/WP we/PRP have/VBP seen/VBN proves/NNS nothing/NN of/IN the/DT sort/NN ./. 
Anyone/NN who/WP argues/VBZ thus/RB is/VBZ being/VBG swayed/VBN by/IN emotion/NN ,/, not/RB logic/JJ ./. 
God/NNP has/VBZ no/DT need/NN to/TO justify/VB His/PRP$ actions/NNS to/TO man/NN ./. 
He/PRP who/WP built/VBD the/DT Universe/NN can/MD destroy/VB it/PRP when/WRB He/PRP chooses/VBZ ./. 
It/PRP is/VBZ arrogance—it/JJ is/VBZ perilously/RB near/IN blasphemy—for/JJ us/PRP to/TO say/VB what/WP He/PRP may/MD or/CC may/MD not/RB do/VB ./. 
This/DT I/PRP could/MD have/VB accepted/VBN ,/, hard/JJ though/IN it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO look/VB upon/JJ whole/JJ worlds/NNS and/CC peoples/NNS thrown/VBN into/IN the/DT furnace/NN ./.

We/PRP could/MD not/RB tell/VB ,/, before/IN we/PRP reached/VBD the/DT nebula/NN ,/, how/WRB long/RB ago/RB the/DT explosion/NN took/VBD place/NN ./. 
Now/RB ,/, from/IN the/DT astronomical/JJ evidence/NN and/CC the/DT record/NN in/IN the/DT rocks/NNS of/IN that/DT one/CD surviving/VBG planet/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN able/JJ to/TO date/NN it/PRP very/RB exactly/RB ./. 
I/PRP know/VBP in/IN what/WP year/NN the/DT light/NN of/IN this/DT colossal/NN conflagration/NN reached/VBD the/DT Earth/NN ./. 
I/PRP know/VBP how/WRB brilliantly/RB the/DT supernova/NN whose/WP$ corpse/NN now/RB dwindles/VBZ behind/IN our/PRP$ speeding/VBG ship/NN once/RB shone/NN in/IN terrestrial/JJ skies/NNS ./.

What/WP was/VBD the/DT need/NN to/TO give/VB these/DT people/NNS to/TO the/DT fire/NN ,/, that/IN the/DT symbol/NN of/IN their/PRP$ passing/NN might/MD shine/VB above/IN Bethlehem/NNP ?/. 
Robert/NNP Armstrong/NNP had/VBD walked/VBN just/RB over/IN two/CD miles/NNS ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN he/PRP could/MD judge/VB ,/, when/WRB his/PRP$ torch/NN failed/VBD ./.

It/PRP landed/VBD somewhere/RB in/IN the/DT darkness/NN ,/, disturbing/VBG the/DT silence/NN of/IN this/DT little/JJ world/NN ./. 
A/DT metallic/JJ echo/NN came/VBD ringing/VBG back/RB from/IN the/DT low/JJ hills/NNS :/: then/RB all/DT was/VBD quiet/JJ again/RB ./. 
This/DT ,/, thought/VBD Armstrong/NNP ,/, was/VBD the/DT ultimate/JJ misfortune/NN ./. 
Nothing/NN more/RBR could/MD happen/VB to/TO him/PRP now/RB ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD even/RB able/JJ to/TO laugh/VB bitterly/RB at/IN his/PRP$ luck/NN ,/, and/CC resolved/VBD never/RB again/RB to/TO imagine/VB that/IN the/DT fickle/NN goddess/NN had/VBD ever/RB favored/VBN him/PRP ./. 
Who/WP would/MD have/VB believed/VBN that/IN the/DT only/JJ tractor/NN at/IN Camp/NNP IV/NNP would/MD have/VB broken/VBN down/RP when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD just/RB setting/VBG off/RP for/IN Port/NNP Sanderson/NNP ?/.

It/PRP was/VBD no/DT use/NN then/RB regretting/VBG the/DT lateness/NN of/IN his/PRP$ departure/NN :/: he/PRP could/MD not/RB have/VB foreseen/JJ these/DT accidents/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB a/DT good/JJ four/CD hours/NNS before/IN the/DT Canopus/NNP took/VBD off/RP ./. 
He/PRP had/VBD to/TO catch/VB her/PRP ,/, whatever/WDT happened/VBD ;/: no/DT other/JJ ship/NN would/MD be/VB touching/VBG at/IN this/DT world/NN for/IN another/DT month/NN ./. 
Apart/RB from/IN the/DT urgency/NN of/IN his/PRP$ business/NN ,/, four/CD more/JJR weeks/NNS on/IN this/DT out-of-the-way/JJ planet/NN were/VBD unthinkable/JJ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD lucky/JJ that/IN Port/NNP Sanderson/NNP was/VBD little/RB more/JJR than/IN six/CD miles/NNS from/IN the/DT camp—not/NN a/DT great/JJ distance/NN ,/, even/RB on/IN foot/NN ./. 
He/PRP had/VBD had/VBN to/TO leave/VB all/DT his/PRP$ equipment/NN behind/IN ,/, but/CC it/PRP could/MD follow/VB on/IN the/DT next/JJ ship/NN and/CC he/PRP could/MD manage/VB without/IN it/PRP ./. 
The/DT road/NN was/VBD poor/JJ ,/, merely/RB stamped/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT rock/NN by/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT Board/NNP ’/NNP s/VBD hundred-ton/JJ crushers/NNS ,/, but/CC there/EX was/VBD no/DT fear/NN of/IN going/VBG astray/NN ./. 
Even/RB now/RB ,/, he/PRP was/VBD in/IN no/DT real/JJ danger/NN ,/, though/IN he/PRP might/MD well/RB be/VB too/RB late/JJ to/TO catch/VB the/DT ship/NN ./.

It/PRP was/VBD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, pitch-dark/NN ./. 
Here/RB at/IN the/DT edge/NN of/IN the/DT Galaxy/NNP the/DT stars/NNS were/VBD so/RB few/JJ and/CC scattered/VBD that/IN their/PRP$ light/NN was/VBD negligible/JJ ./. 
The/DT strange/JJ crimson/JJ sun/NN of/IN this/DT lonely/JJ world/NN would/MD not/RB rise/VB for/IN many/JJ hours/NNS ,/, and/CC although/IN five/CD of/IN the/DT little/JJ moons/NNS were/VBD in/IN the/DT sky/NN ,/, they/PRP could/MD barely/RB be/VB seen/VBN by/IN the/DT unaided/JJ eye/NN ./. 
Not/RB one/CD of/IN them/PRP could/MD even/RB cast/VB a/DT shadow/NN ./. 
Armstrong/NNP was/VBD not/RB the/DT man/NN to/TO bewail/VB his/PRP$ luck/NN for/IN long/RB ./. 
He/PRP began/VBD to/TO walk/VB slowly/RB along/IN the/DT road/NN ,/, feeling/VBG its/PRP$ texture/NN with/IN his/PRP$ feet/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD ,/, he/PRP knew/VBD ,/, fairly/RB straight/JJ except/IN where/WRB it/PRP wound/VBD through/IN Carver/NNP ’/NNP s/JJ Pass/NNP ./. 
He/PRP wished/VBD he/PRP had/VBD a/DT stick/NN or/CC something/NN to/TO probe/VB the/DT way/NN before/IN him/PRP ,/, but/CC he/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO rely/VB for/IN guidance/NN on/IN the/DT feel/NN of/IN the/DT ground/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD terribly/RB slow/JJ at/IN first/JJ ,/, until/IN he/PRP gained/VBD confidence/NN ./. 
He/PRP had/VBD never/RB known/VBN how/WRB difficult/JJ it/PRP was/VBD to/TO walk/VB in/IN a/DT straight/JJ line/NN ./. 
Although/IN the/DT feeble/JJ stars/NNS gave/VBD him/PRP his/PRP$ bearings/NNS ,/, again/RB and/CC again/RB he/PRP found/VBD himself/PRP stumbling/VBG among/IN the/DT virgin/NN rocks/NNS at/IN the/DT edge/NN of/IN the/DT crude/NN roadway/NN ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD traveling/VBG in/IN long/JJ zigzags/NN that/WDT took/VBD him/PRP to/TO alternate/VB sides/NNS of/IN the/DT road/NN ./. 
Then/RB he/PRP would/MD stub/VB his/PRP$ toes/NNS against/IN the/DT bare/NN rock/NN and/CC grope/VB his/PRP$ way/NN back/RB onto/IN the/DT hard-packed/JJ surface/NN once/RB again/RB ./. 
Presently/RB it/PRP settled/VBD down/RB to/TO a/DT routine/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD impossible/JJ to/TO estimate/VB his/PRP$ speed/NN ;/: he/PRP could/MD only/RB struggle/VB along/RB and/CC hope/VB for/IN the/DT best/JJS ./. 
There/EX were/VBD four/CD miles/NNS to/TO go—four/VB miles/NNS and/CC as/IN many/JJ hours/NNS ./. 
It/PRP should/MD be/VB easy/JJ enough/RB ,/, unless/IN he/PRP lost/VBD his/PRP$ way/NN ./. 
But/CC he/PRP dared/VBD not/RB think/VB of/IN that/DT ./. 
Once/RB he/PRP had/VBD mastered/VBN the/DT technique/NN he/PRP could/MD afford/VB the/DT luxury/NN of/IN thought/NN ./. 
He/PRP could/MD not/RB pretend/VB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD enjoying/VBG the/DT experience/NN ,/, but/CC he/PRP had/VBD been/VBN in/IN much/JJ worse/JJR positions/NNS before/IN ./. 
As/RB long/RB as/IN he/PRP remained/VBD on/IN the/DT road/NN ,/, he/PRP was/VBD perfectly/RB safe/JJ ./. 
He/PRP had/VBD been/VBN hoping/VBG that/IN as/IN his/PRP$ eyes/NNS became/VBD adapted/JJ to/TO the/DT starlight/NN he/PRP would/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT way/NN ,/, but/CC he/PRP now/RB knew/VBZ that/IN the/DT whole/JJ journey/NN would/MD be/VB blind/RB ./. 
The/DT discovery/NN gave/VBD him/PRP a/DT vivid/NN sense/NN of/IN his/PRP$ remoteness/NN from/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN the/DT Galaxy/NNP ./. 
On/IN a/DT night/NN as/RB clear/JJ as/IN this/DT ,/, the/DT skies/NNS of/IN almost/RB any/DT other/JJ planet/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN blazing/VBG with/IN stars/NNS ./. 
Here/RB at/IN this/DT outpost/NN of/IN the/DT Universe/NNP the/DT sky/NN held/VBD perhaps/RB a/DT hundred/VBN faintly/RB gleaming/VBG points/NNS of/IN light/NN ,/, as/RB useless/JJ as/IN the/DT five/CD ridiculous/JJ moons/NNS on/IN which/WDT no/DT one/NN had/VBD ever/RB bothered/VBN to/TO land/NN ./. 
A/DT slight/JJ change/NN in/IN the/DT road/NN interrupted/VBD his/PRP$ thoughts/NNS ./.

Did/NNP this/DT mean/NN that/IN he/PRP was/VBD nearing/VBG the/DT Pass/NNP ?/. 
He/PRP hoped/VBD so/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT journey/NN would/MD then/RB be/VB half-completed/JJ ./.

It/PRP was/VBD not/RB a/DT pleasant/JJ thought/NN ,/, and/CC Armstrong/NNP did/VBD not/RB intend/VB to/TO brood/VB upon/IN it/PRP ./.

His/PRP$ strongest/JJS argument/NN was/VBD the/DT complete/JJ barrenness/NN of/IN this/DT world/NN and/CC its/PRP$ utter/JJ desolation/NN ,/, though/IN against/IN that/DT one/CD could/MD set/VB many/JJ counterarguments/NNS ,/, as/IN indeed/RB the/DT old/JJ clerk/NN had/VBD done/VBN ./.

No/DT one/NN could/MD deny/VB that/IN the/DT tunnels/NNS out/RP in/IN the/DT wasteland/NN were/VBD rather/RB puzzling/VBG ,/, but/CC everyone/NN believed/VBD them/PRP to/TO be/VB volcanic/JJ vents/NNS ./. 
Though/NNP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, life/NN often/RB crept/VBD into/IN such/JJ places/NNS ./. 
With/IN a/DT shudder/NN he/PRP remembered/VBD the/DT giant/JJ polyps/NNS that/WDT had/VBD snared/VBN the/DT first/JJ explorers/NNS of/IN Vargon/NNP III/NNP ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD all/DT very/RB inconclusive/JJ ./. 
Suppose/NNP ,/, for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN argument/NN ,/, one/CD granted/VBD the/DT existence/NN of/IN life/NN here/RB ./. 
What/WP of/IN that/DT ?/. 
The/DT vast/JJ majority/NN of/IN life/NN forms/NNS in/IN the/DT Universe/NNP were/VBD completely/RB indifferent/JJ to/TO man/NN ./. 
Some/DT ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, like/IN the/DT gas-beings/NNS of/IN Alcoran/NNP or/CC the/DT roving/VBG wave-lattices/NNS of/IN Shandaloon/NNP ,/, could/MD not/RB even/RB detect/VBP him/PRP but/CC passed/VBD through/IN or/CC around/RB him/PRP as/IN if/IN he/PRP did/VBD not/RB exist/VB ./.

There/EX were/VBD few/JJ indeed/RB that/WDT would/MD attack/VB unless/IN provoked/VBN ./. 
Nevertheless/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT grim/JJ picture/NN that/IN the/DT old/JJ stores/NNS clerk/NN had/VBD painted/VBN ./. 
Back/RB in/IN the/DT warm/JJ ,/, well-lighted/JJ smoking/NN room/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT drinks/NNS going/VBG around/RB ,/, it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN easy/JJ enough/RB to/TO laugh/VB at/IN it/PRP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD almost/RB a/DT relief/NN when/WRB he/PRP stumbled/VBD off/RP the/DT road/NN again/RB and/CC had/VBD to/TO grope/VB with/IN his/PRP$ hands/NNS until/IN he/PRP found/VBD it/PRP once/RB more/RBR ./. 
This/DT seemed/VBD a/DT very/RB rough/JJ patch/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT road/NN was/VBD scarcely/RB distinguishable/JJ from/IN the/DT rocks/NNS around/IN ./. 
In/IN a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, he/PRP was/VBD safely/RB on/IN his/PRP$ way/NN again/RB ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD unpleasant/JJ to/TO see/VB how/WRB quickly/RB his/PRP$ thoughts/NNS returned/VBN to/TO the/DT same/JJ disquieting/NN subject/NN ./. 
Clearly/RB it/PRP was/VBD worrying/VBG him/PRP more/JJR than/IN he/PRP cared/VBD to/TO admit/VB ./. 
He/PRP drew/VBD consolation/NN from/IN one/CD fact/NN :/: it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN quite/RB obvious/JJ that/IN no/DT one/NN at/IN the/DT Base/NNP had/VBD believed/VBN the/DT old/JJ fellow/NN ’/NNP s/VBZ story/NN ./.

After/IN all/DT ,/, what/WP was/VBD the/DT evidence/NN ?/. 
A/DT dim/NN shape/NN ,/, just/RB seen/VBN in/IN the/DT darkness/NN ,/, that/WDT might/MD well/RB have/VB been/VBN an/DT oddly/RB formed/JJ rock/NN ./.

“/NN Because/IN it/PRP was/VBD afraid/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ light/NN ,/, ”/VBP the/DT old/JJ chap/NN had/VBD said/VBD ./.

Armstrong/NNP got/VBD control/NN of/IN his/PRP$ thoughts/NNS again/RB ./. 
If/IN he/PRP went/VBD on/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, he/PRP told/VBD himself/PRP angrily/RB ,/, he/PRP would/MD soon/RB be/VB seeing/VBG and/CC hearing/VBG a/DT whole/JJ menagerie/NN of/IN monsters/NNS ./. 
There/EX was/VBD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, one/CD factor/NN that/WDT disposed/VBD of/IN the/DT ridiculous/JJ story/NN at/IN once/RB ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD really/RB very/RB simple/JJ ;/: he/PRP felt/VBD sorry/NN he/PRP hadn/VBZ ’/JJ t/JJ thought/NN of/IN it/PRP before/IN ./. 
What/WP would/MD such/VB a/DT creature/NN live/NN on/IN ?/. 
There/EX was/VBD not/RB even/RB a/DT trace/NN of/IN vegetation/NN on/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN the/DT planet/NN ./. 
He/PRP laughed/VBD to/TO think/VB that/IN the/DT bogey/NN could/MD be/VB disposed/VBN of/IN so/RB easily—and/VB in/IN the/DT same/JJ instant/NN felt/VBD annoyed/JJ with/IN himself/PRP for/IN not/RB laughing/VBG aloud/NN ./. 
If/IN he/PRP was/VBD so/RB sure/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ reasoning/NN ,/, why/WRB not/RB whistle/VB ,/, or/CC sing/NN ,/, or/CC do/VB anything/NN to/TO keep/VB up/RP his/PRP$ spirits/NNS ?/. 
He/PRP put/VBD the/DT question/NN fairly/RB to/TO himself/PRP as/IN a/DT text/NN of/IN his/PRP$ manhood/NN ./. 
Half-ashamed/NNP ,/, he/PRP had/VBD to/TO admit/VB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD still/RB afraid—afraid/VBN because/RB “/NNP there/EX might/MD be/VB something/NN in/IN it/PRP after/IN all./JJ ”/NN But/CC at/IN least/JJS his/PRP$ analysis/NN had/VBD done/VBN him/PRP some/DT good/NN ./. 
It/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN better/RB if/IN he/PRP had/VBD left/VBN it/PRP there/RB ,/, and/CC remained/VBD half-convinced/JJ by/IN his/PRP$ argument/NN ./. 
But/CC a/DT part/NN of/IN his/PRP$ mind/NN was/VBD still/RB trying/VBG to/TO break/VB down/RP his/PRP$ careful/JJ reasoning/NN ./. 
It/PRP succeeded/VBD only/RB too/RB well/RB ,/, and/CC when/WRB he/PRP remembered/VBD the/DT plant-beings/NNS of/IN Zantil/NNP Major/NNP the/DT shock/NN was/VBD so/RB unpleasant/JJ that/IN he/PRP stopped/VBD dead/JJ in/IN his/PRP$ tracks/NNS ./. 
Now/RB the/DT plant-beings/NNS of/IN Xantil/NNP were/VBD not/RB in/IN any/DT way/NN horrible/JJ ./. 
They/PRP were/VBD in/IN fact/NN extremely/RB beautiful/JJ creatures/NNS ./. 
But/CC what/WP made/VBD them/PRP appear/VB so/IN distressing/VBG now/RB was/VBD the/DT knowledge/NN that/IN they/PRP could/MD live/VB for/IN indefinite/JJ periods/NNS with/IN no/DT food/NN whatsoever/RB ./. 
All/PDT the/DT energy/NN they/PRP needed/VBD for/IN their/PRP$ strange/JJ lives/NNS they/PRP extracted/VBD from/IN cosmic/JJ radiation—and/NN that/WDT was/VBD almost/RB as/IN intense/JJ here/RB as/IN anywhere/RB else/RB in/IN the/DT universe/NN ./. 
He/PRP had/VBD scarcely/RB thought/VBN of/IN one/CD example/NN before/IN others/NNS crowded/VBD into/IN his/PRP$ mind/NN and/CC he/PRP remembered/VBD the/DT life/NN form/NN on/IN Trantor/NNP Beta/NNP ,/, which/WDT was/VBD the/DT only/JJ one/CD known/VBN capable/NN of/IN directly/RB utilizing/VBG atomic/JJ energy/NN ./. 
That/DT too/RB had/VBD lived/VBN on/IN an/DT utterly/JJ barren/NN world/NN ,/, very/RB much/RB like/IN this/DT ./.

Armstrong/NNP ’/NNP s/VBD mind/NN was/VBD rapidly/RB splitting/VBG into/IN two/CD distinct/JJ portions/NNS ,/, each/DT trying/VBG to/TO convince/VB the/DT other/JJ and/CC neither/DT wholly/RB succeeding/VBG ./. 
He/PRP did/VBD not/RB realize/VB how/WRB far/RB his/PRP$ morale/NN had/VBD gone/VBN until/IN he/PRP found/VBD himself/PRP holding/VBG his/PRP$ breath/NN lest/IN it/PRP conceal/VBZ any/DT sound/NN from/IN the/DT darkness/NN about/IN him/PRP ./. 
Angrily/RB ,/, he/PRP cleared/VBD his/PRP$ mind/NN of/IN the/DT rubbish/NN that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN gathering/VBG there/RB and/CC turned/VBD once/RB more/JJR to/TO the/DT immediate/JJ problem/NN ./.

The/DT road/NN began/VBD to/TO twist/VB ,/, and/CC suddenly/RB he/PRP was/VBD aware/JJ of/IN great/JJ rocks/NNS on/IN either/DT side/NN of/IN him/PRP ./.

Somehow/RB ,/, he/PRP felt/VBD safer/NN with/IN the/DT rock/NN walls/NNS surrounding/VBG him/PRP :/: it/PRP meant/VBD that/IN he/PRP was/VBD protected/VBN except/IN in/IN two/CD directions/NNS ./. 
Also/RB ,/, the/DT road/NN had/VBD been/VBN leveled/VBN more/RBR carefully/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD easy/JJ to/TO keep/VB it/PRP ./. 
Best/JJS of/IN all/DT ,/, he/PRP knew/VBD now/RB that/IN the/DT journey/NN was/VBD more/JJR than/IN half/NN completed/VBN ./. 
For/IN a/DT moment/NN his/PRP$ spirits/NNS began/VBD to/TO rise/VB ./. 
Then/RB ,/, with/IN maddening/VBG perversity/NN ,/, his/PRP$ mind/NN went/VBD back/RB into/IN the/DT old/JJ grooves/NNS again/RB ./.

He/PRP was/VBD coming/VBG out/RB into/IN the/DT open/JJ plain/NN once/RB more/RBR ,/, and/CC somewhere/RB not/RB far/RB away/RB in/IN the/DT darkness/NN was/VBD that/IN enigmatic/JJ pillar/NN that/WDT might/MD have/VB been/VBN used/VBN for/IN sharpening/VBG monstrous/JJ fangs/NNS or/CC claws/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD not/RB a/DT reassuring/JJ thought/NN ,/, but/CC he/PRP could/MD not/RB get/VB it/PRP out/IN of/IN his/PRP$ mind/NN ./. 
Feeling/VBG distinctly/RB worried/VBN now/RB ,/, Armstrong/NNP made/VBD great/JJ effort/NN to/TO pull/VB himself/PRP together/RB ./. 
He/PRP would/MD try/VB to/TO be/VB rational/JJ again/RB ;/: he/PRP would/MD think/VB of/IN business/NN ,/, the/DT work/NN he/PRP had/VBD done/VBN at/IN the/DT camp—anything/NN but/CC this/DT infernal/JJ place/NN ./. 
For/IN a/DT while/NN he/PRP succeeded/VBD quite/RB well/RB ./. 
But/CC presently/RB ,/, with/IN a/DT maddening/NN persistence/NN ,/, every/DT train/NN of/IN thought/NN came/VBD back/RB to/TO the/DT same/JJ point/NN ./. 
He/PRP could/MD not/RB get/VB out/IN of/IN his/PRP$ mind/NN the/DT picture/NN of/IN that/DT inexplicable/JJ rock/NN and/CC its/PRP$ appalling/JJ possibilities/NNS ./. 
Over/IN and/CC over/RB again/RB he/PRP found/VBD himself/PRP wondering/VBG how/WRB far/RB away/RB it/PRP was/VBD ,/, whether/IN he/PRP had/VBD already/RB passed/VBN it/PRP ,/, and/CC whether/IN it/PRP was/VBD on/IN his/PRP$ right/NN or/CC his/PRP$ left/NN ./. 
The/DT ground/NN was/VBD quite/RB flat/JJ again/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT road/NN drove/VBD on/IN straight/NN as/IN an/DT arrow/NN ./. 
There/EX was/VBD one/CD gleam/NN of/IN consolation/NN :/: Port/NNP Sanderson/NNP could/MD not/RB be/VB much/RB more/JJR than/IN two/CD miles/NNS away/RB ./. 
Armstrong/NNP had/VBD no/DT idea/NN how/WRB long/RB he/PRP had/VBD been/VBN on/IN the/DT road/NN ./. 
Unfortunately/RB his/PRP$ watch/NN was/VBD not/RB illuminated/JJ and/CC he/PRP could/MD only/RB guess/VB at/IN the/DT passage/NN of/IN time/NN ./. 
With/IN any/DT luck/NN ,/, the/DT Canopus/NNP should/MD not/RB take/VB off/RP for/IN another/DT two/CD hours/NNS at/IN least/JJS ./. 
But/CC he/PRP could/MD not/RB be/VB sure/JJ ,/, and/CC now/RB another/DT fear/NN began/VBD to/TO enter/VB his/PRP$ mind—the/NN dread/NN that/IN he/PRP might/MD see/VB a/DT vast/JJ constellation/NN of/IN lights/NNS rising/VBG swiftly/RB into/IN the/DT sky/NN ahead/RB ,/, and/CC know/VB that/IN all/PDT this/DT agony/NN of/IN mind/NN had/VBD been/VBN in/IN vain/NN ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD not/RB zigzagging/VBG so/RB badly/RB now/RB ,/, and/CC seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO anticipate/VB the/DT edge/NN of/IN the/DT road/NN before/IN stumbling/VBG off/RP it/PRP ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD probable/JJ ,/, he/PRP cheered/VBD himself/PRP by/IN thinking/VBG ,/, that/IN he/PRP was/VBD traveling/VBG almost/RB as/RB fast/RB as/IN if/IN he/PRP had/VBD a/DT light/NN ./. 
If/IN all/DT went/VBD well/RB ,/, he/PRP might/MD be/VB nearing/VBG Port/NNP Sanderson/NNP in/IN thirty/NN minutes—a/NN ridiculously/RB small/JJ space/NN of/IN time/NN ./. 
How/WRB he/PRP would/MD laugh/VB at/IN his/PRP$ fears/NNS when/WRB he/PRP strolled/VBD into/IN his/PRP$ already/RB reserved/VBN stateroom/NN in/IN the/DT “/NNP Canopus/NNP ,/, ”/NNP and/CC felt/VBD that/IN peculiar/JJ quiver/RB as/IN the/DT phantom/NN drive/NN hurled/VBD the/DT great/JJ ship/NN far/RB out/IN of/IN this/DT system/NN ,/, back/RB to/TO the/DT clustered/VBN star-clouds/NN near/IN the/DT center/NN of/IN the/DT Galaxy—back/NNP toward/IN Earth/NNP itself/PRP ,/, which/WDT he/PRP had/VBD not/RB seen/VBN for/IN so/RB many/JJ years/NNS ./. 
One/CD day/NN ,/, he/PRP told/VBD himself/PRP ,/, he/PRP really/RB must/MD visit/VB Earth/NNP again/RB ./. 
All/PDT his/PRP$ life/NN he/PRP had/VBD been/VBN making/VBG the/DT promise/NN ,/, but/CC always/RB there/EX had/VBD been/VBN the/DT same/JJ answer—lack/NN of/IN time/NN ./. 
Strange/NNP ,/, wasn/NN ’/NNP t/NN it/PRP ,/, that/IN such/PDT a/DT tiny/JJ planet/NN should/MD have/VB played/VBN so/RB enormous/JJ a/DT part/NN in/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT Universe/NNP ,/, should/MD even/RB have/VB come/VBN to/TO dominate/VB worlds/NNS far/RB wiser/JJR and/CC more/RBR intelligent/NN than/IN itself/PRP !/. 
Armstrong/NNP ’/NNP s/NN thoughts/NNS were/VBD harmless/RB again/RB ,/, and/CC he/PRP felt/VBD calmer/NN ./. 
The/DT knowledge/NN that/IN he/PRP was/VBD nearing/VBG Port/NNP Sanderson/NNP was/VBD immensely/RB reassuring/JJ ,/, and/CC he/PRP deliberately/RB kept/VBD his/PRP$ mind/NN on/IN familiar/JJ ,/, unimportant/JJ matters/NNS ./. 
Carver/NNP ’/NNP s/VBD Pass/NNP was/VBD already/RB far/RB behind/IN ,/, and/CC with/IN it/PRP that/IN thing/NN he/PRP no/RB longer/RBR intended/VBN to/TO recall/VB ./. 
One/CD day/NN ,/, if/IN he/PRP ever/RB returned/VBD to/TO this/DT world/NN ,/, he/PRP would/MD visit/VB the/DT pass/NN in/IN the/DT daytime/NN and/CC laugh/NN at/IN his/PRP$ fears/NNS ./. 
In/IN twenty/JJ minutes/NNS now/RB ,/, they/PRP would/MD have/VB joined/VBN the/DT nightmares/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ childhood/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD almost/RB a/DT shock/NN ,/, though/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS pleasant/JJ he/PRP had/VBD ever/RB known/VBN ,/, when/WRB he/PRP saw/VBD the/DT lights/NNS of/IN Port/NNP Sanderson/NNP come/VBP up/RP over/IN the/DT horizon/NN ./. 
The/DT curvature/NN of/IN this/DT little/JJ world/NN was/VBD very/RB deceptive/JJ :/: it/PRP did/VBD not/RB seem/VB right/RB that/IN a/DT planet/NN with/IN a/DT gravity/NN almost/RB as/RB great/JJ as/IN Earth/NNP ’/NNP s/NN should/MD have/VB a/DT horizon/NN so/RB close/RB at/IN hand/NN ./. 
One/CD day/NN ,/, someone/NN would/MD have/VB to/TO discover/VB what/WP lay/NN at/IN this/DT world/NN ’/VBZ s/JJ core/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP so/RB great/JJ a/DT density/NN ./. 
Perhaps/RB the/DT many/JJ tunnels/NNS would/MD help—it/VB was/VBD an/DT unfortunate/JJ turn/NN of/IN thought/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT nearness/NN of/IN his/PRP$ goal/NN had/VBD robbed/VBN it/PRP of/IN terror/NN now/RB ./. 
Indeed/RB ,/, the/DT thought/NN that/IN he/PRP might/MD really/RB be/VB in/IN danger/NN seemed/VBD to/TO give/VB his/PRP$ adventure/NN a/DT certain/JJ piquancy/NN and/CC heightened/VBN interest/NN ./. 
Nothing/NN could/MD happen/VB to/TO hims/VB now/RB ,/, with/IN ten/JJ minutes/NNS to/TO go/VB and/CC the/DT lights/NNS of/IN the/DT Port/NNP already/RB in/IN sight/NN ./. 
A/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS later/RB ,/, his/PRP$ feelings/NNS changed/VBD abruptly/RB when/WRB he/PRP came/VBD to/TO the/DT sudden/JJ bend/NN in/IN the/DT road/NN ./. 
He/PRP had/VBD forgotten/VBN the/DT chasm/NN that/WDT caused/VBD his/PRP$ detour/NN ,/, and/CC added/VBD half/NN a/DT mile/NN to/TO the/DT journey/NN ./. 
Well/RB ,/, what/WP of/IN it/PRP ?/. 
He/PRP thought/VBD stubbornly/RB ./. 
An/DT extra/JJ half-mile/NN would/MD make/VB no/DT difference/NN now—another/RB ten/JJ minutes/NNS ,/, at/IN the/DT most/RBS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB disappointing/JJ when/WRB the/DT lights/NNS of/IN the/DT city/NN vanished/VBN ./. 
Armstrong/NNP had/VBD not/RB remembered/VBN the/DT hill/NN which/WDT the/DT road/NN was/VBD skirting/VBG ,/, perhaps/RB it/PRP was/VBD only/RB a/DT low/JJ ridge/NN ,/, scarcely/RB noticeable/JJ in/IN the/DT daytime/NN ./. 
But/CC by/IN hiding/VBG the/DT lights/NNS of/IN the/DT port/NN it/PRP had/VBD taken/VBN away/RP his/PRP$ chief/JJ talisman/NN and/CC left/VBD him/PRP again/RB at/IN the/DT mercy/NN of/IN his/PRP$ fears/NNS ./. 
Very/RB unreasonably/RB ,/, his/PRP$ intelligence/NN told/VBD him/PRP ,/, he/PRP began/VBD to/TO think/VB how/WRB horrible/JJ it/PRP would/MD be/VB if/IN anything/NN happened/VBD now/RB ,/, so/RB near/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT journey/NN ./. 
He/PRP kept/VBD the/DT worst/JJS of/IN his/PRP$ fears/NNS at/IN bay/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, hoping/VBG desperately/RB that/IN the/DT lights/NNS of/IN the/DT city/NN would/MD soon/RB reappear/VB ./. 
But/CC as/IN the/DT minutes/NNS dragged/VBD on/IN ,/, he/PRP realized/VBD that/IN the/DT ridge/NN must/MD be/VB longer/JJR than/IN he/PRP imagined/VBD ./. 
He/PRP tried/VBD to/TO cheer/VB himself/PRP by/IN the/DT thought/NN that/IN the/DT city/NN would/MD be/VB all/PDT the/DT nearer/NN when/WRB he/PRP saw/VBD it/PRP again/RB ,/, but/CC somehow/RB logic/JJ seemed/VBD to/TO have/VB failed/VBN him/PRP now/RB ./. 
For/IN presently/RB he/PRP found/VBD himself/PRP doing/VBG something/NN he/PRP had/VBD not/RB stooped/VBN to/TO ,/, even/RB out/RP in/IN the/DT waste/NN by/IN Carver/NNP ’/NNP s/JJ Pass/NNP ./. 
He/PRP stopped/VBD ,/, turned/VBD slowly/RB round/NN ,/, and/CC with/IN bated/VBN breath/NN listened/VBN until/IN his/PRP$ lungs/NNS were/VBD nearly/RB bursting/VBG ./. 
The/DT silence/NN was/VBD uncanny/JJ ,/, considering/VBG how/WRB near/IN he/PRP must/MD be/VB to/TO the/DT Port/NNP ./. 
There/EX was/VBD certainly/RB no/RB sound/NN from/IN behind/IN him/PRP ./. 
Of/IN course/NN there/EX wouldn/JJ ’/NN t/NN be/VB ,/, he/PRP told/VBD himself/PRP angrily/RB ./. 
But/CC he/PRP was/VBD immensely/RB relieved/VBN ./. 
The/DT thought/NN of/IN that/DT faint/NN and/CC insistent/NN clicking/NN had/VBD been/VBN haunting/VBG him/PRP for/IN the/DT last/JJ hour/NN ./. 
So/RB friendly/JJ and/CC familiar/JJ was/VBD the/DT noise/NN that/WDT did/VBD reach/VB him/PRP at/IN last/JJ that/IN the/DT anticlimax/NN almost/RB made/VBD him/PRP laugh/JJ aloud/NN ./. 
Drifting/VBG through/IN the/DT still/RB air/NN from/IN a/DT source/NN clearly/RB not/RB more/RBR than/IN a/DT mile/JJ away/RB came/VBD the/DT sound/NN of/IN a/DT landing-field/JJ tractor/NN ,/, perhaps/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT machines/NNS loading/VBG the/DT Canopus/NNP itself/PRP ./. 
In/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN seconds/NNS ,/, thought/VBN Armstrong/NNP ,/, he/PRP would/MD be/VB around/IN this/DT ridge/NN with/IN the/DT Port/NNP only/RB a/DT few/JJ hundred/JJ yards/NNS ahead/RB ./. 
The/DT journey/NN was/VBD nearly/RB ended/VBN ./. 
In/IN a/DT few/JJ moments/NNS ,/, this/DT evil/JJ plain/NN would/MD be/VB no/RB more/JJR than/IN a/DT fading/JJ nightmare/NN ./. 
It/PRP seemed/VBD terribly/RB unfair/JJ :/: so/RB little/JJ time/NN ,/, such/PDT a/DT small/JJ fraction/NN of/IN a/DT human/JJ life/NN ,/, was/VBD all/DT he/PRP needed/VBD now/RB ./. 
But/CC the/DT gods/NNS have/VBP always/RB been/VBN unfair/JJ to/TO man/NN ,/, and/CC now/RB there/EX were/VBD enjoying/VBG their/PRP$ little/JJ jest/NN ./. 
For/IN there/EX could/MD be/VB no/DT mistaking/VBG the/DT rattle/NN of/IN monstrous/JJ claws/NNS in/IN the/DT darkness/NN ahead/RB of/IN him/PRP ./. 
IN/NNP MAKING/NNP THIS/NNP STATEMENT—which/NNP I/PRP do/VBP of/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ free/JJ will—I/NN wish/NN first/RB to/TO make/VB it/PRP perfectly/RB clear/JJ that/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB in/IN any/DT way/NN trying/VBG to/TO gain/VB sympathy/NN ,/, nor/CC do/VBP I/PRP expect/VB any/DT mitigation/NN of/IN whatever/WDT sentence/NN the/DT Court/NNP may/MD pronounce/VB ./. 
I/PRP am/VBP writing/VBG this/DT in/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO refute/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT lying/NN reports/NNS broadcast/NN over/IN the/DT prison/NN radio/NN and/CC published/VBN in/IN the/DT papers/NNS I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN allowed/VBN to/TO see/VB ./. 
These/DT have/VBP given/VBN an/DT entirely/RB false/JJ picture/NN of/IN the/DT true/JJ cause/NN of/IN our/PRP$ defeat/NN ,/, and/CC as/IN the/DT leader/NN of/IN my/PRP$ race/NN 's/POS armed/JJ forces/NNS at/IN the/DT cessation/NN of/IN hostilities/NNS I/PRP feel/VBP it/PRP my/PRP$ duty/NN to/TO protest/VB against/IN such/JJ libels/NNS upon/IN those/DT who/WP served/VBD under/IN me/PRP ./. 
I/PRP also/RB hope/VBP that/IN this/DT statement/NN may/MD explain/VB the/DT reasons/NNS for/IN the/DT application/NN I/PRP have/VBP twice/RB made/VBN to/TO the/DT Court/NNP ,/, and/CC will/MD now/RB induce/VB it/PRP to/TO grant/VB a/DT favor/NN for/IN which/WDT I/PRP can/MD see/VB no/DT possible/JJ grounds/NNS of/IN refusal/NN ./. 
The/DT ultimate/JJ cause/NN of/IN our/PRP$ failure/NN was/VBD a/DT simple/JJ one/CD :/: despite/IN all/DT statements/NNS to/TO the/DT contrary/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD not/RB due/JJ to/TO lack/VB of/IN bravery/NN on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ men/NNS ,/, or/CC to/TO any/DT fault/NN of/IN the/DT Fleet/NNP 's/POS ./. 
We/PRP were/VBD defeated/VBN by/IN one/CD thing/NN only—by/VBZ the/DT inferior/JJ science/NN of/IN our/PRP$ enemies/NNS ./. 
I/PRP repeat—by/VBP the/DT inferior/JJ science/NN of/IN our/PRP$ enemies/NNS ./. 
When/WRB the/DT war/NN opened/VBD we/PRP had/VBD no/DT doubt/NN of/IN our/PRP$ ultimate/JJ victory/NN ./. 
The/DT combined/JJ fleets/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ allies/NNS greatly/RB exceeded/VBD in/IN number/NN and/CC armament/NN those/DT which/WDT the/DT enemy/NN could/MD muster/VB against/IN us/PRP ,/, and/CC in/IN almost/RB all/DT branches/NNS of/IN military/JJ science/NN we/PRP were/VBD their/PRP$ superiors/NNS ./. 
We/PRP were/VBD sure/JJ that/IN we/PRP could/MD maintain/VB this/DT superiority/NN ./. 
Our/PRP$ belief/NN proved/VBN ,/, alas/UH ,/, to/TO be/VB only/RB too/RB well/RB founded/VBN ./. 
At/IN the/DT opening/NN of/IN the/DT war/NN our/PRP$ main/JJ weapons/NNS were/VBD the/DT long-range/JJ homing/NN torpedo/NN ,/, dirigible/JJ ball-lightning/NN and/CC the/DT various/JJ modifications/NNS of/IN the/DT Klydon/NNP beam/NN ./. 
Every/DT unit/NN of/IN the/DT Fleet/NNP was/VBD equipped/VBN with/IN these/DT and/CC though/IN the/DT enemy/NN possessed/VBD similar/JJ weapons/NNS their/PRP$ installations/NNS were/VBD generally/RB of/IN lesser/JJR power/NN ./. 
Moreover/RB ,/, we/PRP had/VBD behind/IN us/PRP a/DT far/RB greater/JJR military/JJ Research/NNP Organization/NNP ,/, and/CC with/IN this/DT initial/JJ advantage/NN we/PRP could/MD not/RB possibly/RB lose/VB ./. 
The/DT campaign/NN proceeded/VBD according/VBG to/TO plan/NN until/IN the/DT Battle/NNP of/IN the/DT Five/NNP Suns/NNPS ./. 
We/PRP won/VBD this/DT ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT opposition/NN proved/VBD stronger/JJR than/IN we/PRP had/VBD expected/VBN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD realized/VBN that/IN victory/NN might/MD be/VB more/RBR difficult/JJ ,/, and/CC more/JJR delayed/NNS ,/, than/IN had/VBD first/JJ been/VBN imagined/VBN ./. 
A/DT conference/NN of/IN supreme/JJ commanders/NNS was/VBD therefore/RB called/VBN to/TO discuss/VB our/PRP$ future/NN strategy/NN ./. 
Present/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN at/IN one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ war/NN conferences/NNS was/VBD Professor-General/JJ Norden/NNP ,/, the/DT new/JJ Chief/NNP of/IN the/DT Research/NNP Staff/NNP ,/, who/WP had/VBD just/RB been/VBN appointed/VBN to/TO fill/VB the/DT gap/NN left/VBN by/IN the/DT death/NN of/IN Malvar/NNP ,/, our/PRP$ greatest/JJS scientist/NN ./. 
Malvar/NNP 's/POS leadership/NN had/VBD been/VBN responsible/JJ ,/, more/RBR than/IN any/DT other/JJ single/JJ factor/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT efficiency/NN and/CC power/NN of/IN our/PRP$ weapons/NNS ./. 
His/PRP$ loss/NN was/VBD a/DT very/RB serious/JJ blow/NN ,/, but/CC no/DT one/NN doubted/VBD the/DT brilliance/NN of/IN his/PRP$ successor—though/JJ many/JJ of/IN us/PRP disputed/VBD the/DT wisdom/NN of/IN appointing/VBG a/DT theoretical/JJ scientist/NN to/TO fill/VB a/DT post/NN of/IN such/JJ vital/JJ importance/NN ./. 
But/CC we/PRP had/VBD been/VBN overruled/VBN ./. 
I/PRP can/MD well/RB remember/VB the/DT impression/NN Norden/NNP made/VBD at/IN that/DT conference/NN ./. 
The/DT military/JJ advisers/NNS were/VBD worried/VBN ,/, and/CC as/IN usual/JJ turned/VBD to/TO the/DT scientists/NNS for/IN help/NN ./. 
Would/MD it/PRP be/VB possible/JJ to/TO improve/VB our/PRP$ existing/VBG weapons/NNS ,/, they/PRP asked/VBD ,/, so/IN that/IN our/PRP$ present/JJ advantage/NN could/MD be/VB increased/VBN still/RB further/RBR ?/. 
Norden/NNP 's/POS reply/NN was/VBD quite/RB unexpected/JJ ./. 
Malvar/NNP had/VBD often/RB been/VBN asked/VBN such/PDT a/DT question—and/NN he/PRP had/VBD always/RB done/VBN what/WP we/PRP requested/VBD ./. 
``/`` Frankly/RB ,/, gentlemen/NNS ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Norden/NNP ,/, ``/`` I/PRP doubt/VBP it/PRP ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP afraid/JJ ,/, the/DT result/NN of/IN a/DT tradition/NN that/WDT has/VBZ become/VBN conservative/JJ ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ fortunate/JJ for/IN us/PRP that/IN our/PRP$ opponents/NNS have/VBP been/VBN no/DT wiser/NN :/: we/PRP can/MD not/RB assume/VB that/IN this/DT will/MD always/RB be/VB so/RB ./. ''/'' 
Norden/NNP 's/POS words/NNS left/VBD an/DT uncomfortable/JJ impression/NN ,/, as/IN he/PRP had/VBD no/DT doubt/NN intended/VBN ./.

``/`` What/WP we/PRP want/VBP are/VBP new/JJ weapons—weapons/NNS totally/RB different/JJ from/IN any/DT that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN employed/VBN before/IN ./.

I/PRP believe/VBP ,/, in/IN fact/NN ,/, that/IN a/DT revolution/NN in/IN warfare/NN may/MD soon/RB be/VB upon/IN us/PRP ./. ''/'' 
We/PRP were/VBD skeptical/JJ ./. 
There/EX was/VBD a/DT bombastic/JJ tone/NN in/IN Norden/NNP 's/POS voice/NN that/IN made/VBD us/PRP suspicious/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ claims/NNS ./. 
We/PRP did/VBD not/RB know/VB ,/, then/RB ,/, that/IN he/PRP never/RB promised/VBD anything/NN that/IN he/PRP had/VBD not/RB already/RB almost/RB perfected/VBN in/IN the/DT laboratory/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT laboratory—that/NN was/VBD the/DT operative/JJ phrase/NN ./. 
Norden/NNP proved/VBD his/PRP$ case/NN less/JJR than/IN a/DT month/NN later/RB ,/, when/WRB he/PRP demonstrated/VBD the/DT Sphere/NNP of/IN Annihilation/NNP ,/, which/WDT produced/VBD complete/JJ disintegration/NN of/IN matter/NN over/IN a/DT radius/NN of/IN several/JJ hundred/CD meters/NNS ./. 
We/PRP were/VBD intoxicated/VBN by/IN the/DT power/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ weapon/NN ,/, and/CC were/VBD quite/RB prepared/JJ to/TO overlook/VB one/CD fundamental/JJ defect—the/NN fact/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT sphere/JJ and/CC hence/RB destroyed/VBD its/PRP$ rather/RB complicated/VBN generating/VBG equipment/NN at/IN the/DT instant/NN of/IN formation/NN ./. 
This/DT meant/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, that/IN it/PRP could/MD not/RB be/VB used/VBN on/IN warships/NNS but/CC only/RB on/IN guided/JJ missiles/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT great/JJ program/NN was/VBD started/VBN to/TO convert/VB all/DT homing/NN torpedoes/NNS to/TO carry/VB the/DT new/JJ weapon/NN ./. 
For/IN the/DT time/NN being/VBG all/DT further/JJ offensives/NNS were/VBD suspended/VBN ./. 
We/PRP realize/VBP now/RB that/IN this/DT was/VBD our/PRP$ first/JJ mistake/NN ./. 
I/PRP still/RB think/VBP that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT natural/JJ one/CD ,/, for/IN it/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO us/PRP then/RB that/IN all/DT our/PRP$ existing/VBG weapons/NNS had/VBD become/VBN obsolete/JJ overnight/JJ ,/, and/CC we/PRP already/RB regarded/VBD them/PRP as/IN almost/RB primitive/JJ survivals/NNS ./.

After/IN six/CD months/NNS ,/, the/DT heavy/JJ units/NNS of/IN the/DT Fleet/NNP were/VBD being/VBG equipped/VBN with/IN the/DT Sphere/NNP ./. 
Training/VBG maneuvers/NNS and/CC tests/NNS had/VBD shown/VBN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD operating/VBG satisfactorily/RB and/CC we/PRP were/VBD ready/JJ to/TO take/VB it/PRP into/IN action/NN ./. 
Norden/NNP was/VBD already/RB being/VBG hailed/VBN as/IN the/DT architect/NN of/IN victory/NN ,/, and/CC had/VBD half/NN promised/VBN even/RB more/RBR spectacular/JJ weapons/NNS ./. 
Then/RB two/CD things/NNS happened/VBD ./. 
One/CD of/IN our/PRP$ battleships/NNS disappeared/VBD completely/RB on/IN a/DT training/NN flight/NN ,/, and/CC an/DT investigation/NN showed/VBD that/IN under/IN certain/JJ conditions/NNS the/DT ship/NN 's/POS long-range/JJ radar/NN could/MD trigger/VB the/DT Sphere/NNP immediately/RB after/IN it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN launched/VBN ./. 
The/DT modification/NN needed/VBD to/TO overcome/VB this/DT defect/NN was/VBD trivial/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP caused/VBD a/DT delay/NN of/IN another/DT month/NN and/CC was/VBD the/DT source/NN of/IN much/JJ bad/JJ feeling/NN between/IN the/DT naval/JJ staff/NN and/CC the/DT scientists/NNS ./. 
We/PRP were/VBD ready/JJ for/IN action/NN again—when/NN Norden/NNP announced/VBD that/IN the/DT radius/NN of/IN effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT Sphere/NNP had/VBD now/RB been/VBN increased/VBN by/IN ten/NN ,/, thus/RB multiplying/VBG by/IN a/DT thousand/CD the/DT chances/NNS of/IN destroying/VBG an/DT enemy/NN ship/NN ./. 
So/IN the/DT modifications/NNS started/VBD all/DT over/RB again/RB ,/, but/CC everyone/NN agreed/VBD that/IN the/DT delay/NN would/MD be/VB worth/IN it/PRP ./. 
Meanwhile/RB ,/, however/RB ,/, the/DT enemy/NN had/VBD been/VBN emboldened/VBN by/IN the/DT absence/NN of/IN further/JJ attacks/NNS and/CC had/VBD made/VBN an/DT unexpected/JJ onslaught/NN ./. 
Our/PRP$ ships/NNS were/VBD short/JJ of/IN torpedoes/NNS ,/, since/IN none/NN had/VBD been/VBN coming/VBG from/IN the/DT factories/NNS ,/, and/CC were/VBD forced/VBN to/TO retire/VB ./. 
So/IN we/PRP lost/VBD the/DT systems/NNS of/IN Kyrane/NNP and/CC Floranus/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT planetary/JJ fortress/NN of/IN Rhamsandron/NNP ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD an/DT annoying/VBG but/CC not/RB a/DT serious/JJ blow/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT recaptured/JJ systems/NNS had/VBD been/VBN unfriendly/RB ,/, and/CC difficult/JJ to/TO administer/VB ./. 
We/PRP had/VBD no/DT doubt/NN that/IN we/PRP could/MD restore/VB the/DT position/NN in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN ,/, as/RB soon/RB as/IN the/DT new/JJ weapon/NN became/VBD operational/JJ ./. 
These/DT hopes/NNS were/VBD only/RB partially/RB fulfilled/VBN ./. 
When/WRB we/PRP renewed/VBD our/PRP$ offensive/JJ ,/, we/PRP had/VBD to/TO do/VB so/RB with/IN fewer/JJR of/IN the/DT Spheres/NNP of/IN Annihilation/NNP than/IN had/VBD been/VBN planned/VBN ,/, and/CC this/DT was/VBD one/CD reason/NN for/IN our/PRP$ limited/JJ success/NN ./. 
The/DT other/JJ reason/NN was/VBD more/RBR serious/JJ ./. 
While/IN we/PRP had/VBD been/VBN equipping/VBG as/IN many/JJ of/IN our/PRP$ ships/NNS as/IN we/PRP could/MD with/IN the/DT irresistible/JJ weapon/NN ,/, the/DT enemy/NN had/VBD been/VBN building/VBG feverishly/RB ./. 
His/PRP$ ships/NNS were/VBD of/IN the/DT old/JJ pattern/NN with/IN the/DT old/JJ weapons—but/NN they/PRP now/RB out-numbered/JJ ours/NNS ./. 
When/WRB we/PRP went/VBD into/IN action/NN ,/, we/PRP found/VBD that/IN the/DT numbers/NNS ranged/VBD against/IN us/PRP were/VBD often/RB 100/CD percent/NN greater/JJR than/IN expected/VBN ,/, causing/VBG target/NN confusion/NN among/IN the/DT automatic/JJ weapons/NNS and/CC resulting/VBG in/IN higher/JJR losses/NNS than/IN anticipated/VBN ./. 
The/DT enemy/NN losses/NNS were/VBD higher/JJR still/RB ,/, for/IN once/RB a/DT Sphere/NNP had/VBD reached/VBN its/PRP$ objective/NN ,/, destruction/NN was/VBD certain/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT balance/NN had/VBD not/RB swung/VBN as/IN far/RB in/IN our/PRP$ favor/NN as/IN we/PRP had/VBD hoped/VBN ./. 
Moreover/RB ,/, while/IN the/DT main/JJ fleets/NNS had/VBD been/VBN engaged/VBN ,/, the/DT enemy/NN had/VBD launched/VBN a/DT daring/VBG attack/NN on/IN the/DT lightly/RB held/VBN systems/NNS of/IN Eriston/NNP ,/, Duranus/NNP ,/, Carmanidora/NNP and/CC Pharanidon—recapturing/VBG them/PRP all/DT ./. 
We/PRP were/VBD thus/RB faced/VBN with/IN a/DT threat/NN only/RB fifty/JJ light-years/NNS from/IN our/PRP$ home/NN planets/NNS ./. 
There/EX was/VBD much/JJ recrimination/NN at/IN the/DT next/JJ meeting/NN of/IN the/DT supreme/JJ commanders/NNS ./. 
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT complaints/NNS were/VBD addressed/VBN to/TO Norden-Grand/NNP Admiral/NNP Taxaris/NNP in/IN particular/JJ maintaining/NN that/WDT thanks/VBZ to/TO our/PRP$ admittedly/RB irresistible/JJ weapon/IN we/PRP were/VBD now/RB considerably/RB worse/JJR off/RP than/IN before/RB ./. 
We/PRP should/MD ,/, he/PRP claimed/VBD ,/, have/VBP continued/VBN to/TO build/VB conventional/JJ ships/NNS ,/, thus/RB preventing/VBG the/DT loss/NN of/IN our/PRP$ numerical/JJ superiority/NN ./. 
Norden/NNP was/VBD equally/RB angry/JJ and/CC called/VBD the/DT naval/JJ staff/NN ungrateful/JJ bunglers/NNS ./. 
But/CC I/PRP could/MD tell/VB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD worried—as/JJ indeed/RB we/PRP all/DT were—by/VBP the/DT unexpected/JJ turn/NN of/IN events/NNS ./. 
He/PRP hinted/VBD that/IN there/EX might/MD be/VB a/DT speedy/JJ way/NN of/IN remedying/VBG the/DT situation/NN ./. 
We/PRP now/RB know/VBP that/IN Research/NNP had/VBD been/VBN working/VBG on/IN the/DT Battle/NNP Analyzer/NNP for/IN many/JJ years/NNS ,/, but/CC at/IN the/DT time/NN it/PRP came/VBD as/IN a/DT revelation/NN to/TO us/PRP and/CC perhaps/RB we/PRP were/VBD too/RB easily/RB swept/VBD off/RP our/PRP$ feet/NNS ./. 
Norden/NNP 's/POS argument/NN ,/, also/RB ,/, was/VBD seductively/RB convincing/JJ ./. 
What/WP did/VBD it/PRP matter/NN ,/, he/PRP said/VBD ,/, if/IN the/DT enemy/NN had/VBD twice/RB as/RB many/JJ ships/NNS as/IN we—if/NN the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN ours/NNS could/MD be/VB doubled/VBN or/CC even/RB trebled/VBN ?/. 
For/IN decades/NNS the/DT limiting/VBG factor/NN in/IN warfare/NN had/VBD been/VBN not/RB mechanical/JJ but/CC biological—it/NN had/VBD become/VBN more/RBR and/CC more/RBR difficult/JJ for/IN any/DT single/JJ mind/NN ,/, or/CC group/NN of/IN minds/NNS ,/, to/TO cope/VB with/IN the/DT rapidly/RB changing/VBG complexities/NNS of/IN battle/NN in/IN three-dimensional/JJ space/NN ./. 
Norden/NNP 's/POS mathematicians/NNS had/VBD analyzed/VBN some/DT of/IN the/DT classic/JJ engagements/NNS of/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, and/CC had/VBD shown/VBN that/IN even/RB when/WRB we/PRP had/VBD been/VBN victorious/JJ we/PRP had/VBD often/RB operated/VBN our/PRP$ units/NNS at/IN much/RB less/JJR than/IN half/NN of/IN their/PRP$ theoretical/JJ efficiency/NN ./. 
The/DT Battle/NNP Analyzer/NNP would/MD change/VB all/DT this/DT by/IN replacing/VBG the/DT operations/NNS staff/NN with/IN electronic/JJ calculators/NNS ./. 
The/DT idea/NN was/VBD not/RB new/JJ ,/, in/IN theory/NN ,/, but/CC until/IN now/RB it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN no/RB more/RBR than/IN a/DT Utopian/JJ dream/NN ./. 
Many/JJ of/IN us/PRP found/VBD it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO believe/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD still/RB anything/NN but/CC a/DT dream/NN :/: after/IN we/PRP had/VBD run/VBN through/IN several/JJ very/RB complex/JJ dummy/NN battles/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, we/PRP were/VBD convinced/VBN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD decided/VBN to/TO install/VB the/DT Analyzer/NNP in/IN four/CD of/IN our/PRP$ heaviest/JJS ships/NNS ,/, so/IN that/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT main/JJ fleets/NNS could/MD be/VB equipped/VBN with/IN one/CD ./. 
At/IN this/DT stage/NN ,/, the/DT trouble/NN began—though/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB know/VB it/PRP until/IN later/RBR ./. 
The/DT Analyzer/NNP contained/VBD just/RB short/JJ of/IN a/DT million/CD vacuum/NN tubes/NNS and/CC needed/VBD a/DT team/NN of/IN five/CD hundred/NNS technicians/NNS to/TO maintain/VB and/CC operate/VB it/PRP ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD quite/RB impossible/JJ to/TO accommodate/VB the/DT extra/JJ staff/NN aboard/IN a/DT battleship/NN ,/, so/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT four/CD units/NNS had/VBD to/TO be/VB accompanied/VBN by/IN a/DT converted/JJ liner/NN to/TO carry/VB the/DT technicians/NNS not/RB on/IN duty/NN ./. 
Installation/NN was/VBD also/RB a/DT very/RB slow/JJ and/CC tedious/JJ business/NN ,/, but/CC by/IN gigantic/JJ efforts/NNS it/PRP was/VBD completed/VBN in/IN six/CD months/NNS ./. 
Then/RB ,/, to/TO our/PRP$ dismay/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD confronted/VBN by/IN another/DT crisis/NN ./. 
Nearly/RB five/CD thousand/NNS highly/RB skilled/VBN men/NNS had/VBD been/VBN selected/VBN to/TO serve/VB the/DT Analyzers/NNP and/CC had/VBD been/VBN given/VBN an/DT intensive/JJ course/NN at/IN the/DT Technical/NNP Training/NNP Schools/NNP ./. 
At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN seven/CD months/NNS ,/, 10/CD percent/NN of/IN them/PRP had/VBD had/VBN nervous/JJ breakdowns/NNS and/CC only/RB 40/CD per/IN cent/NN had/VBD qualified/VBN ./. 
Once/RB again/RB ,/, everyone/NN started/VBD to/TO blame/VB everyone/NN else/RB ./. 
Norden/NNP ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, said/VBD that/IN the/DT Research/NNP Staff/NNP could/MD not/RB be/VB held/VBN responsible/JJ ,/, and/CC so/RB incurred/VBD the/DT enmity/NN of/IN the/DT Personnel/NNP and/CC Training/NNP Commands/NNP ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD finally/RB decided/VBD that/IN the/DT only/JJ thing/NN to/TO do/VB was/VBD to/TO use/VB two/CD instead/RB of/IN four/CD Analyzers/NNS and/CC to/TO bring/VB the/DT others/NNS into/IN action/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN men/NNS could/MD be/VB trained/VBN ./. 
There/EX was/VBD little/JJ time/NN to/TO lose/VB ,/, for/IN the/DT enemy/NN was/VBD still/RB on/IN the/DT offensive/JJ and/CC his/PRP$ morale/NN was/VBD rising/VBG ./. 
The/DT first/JJ Analyzer/NNP fleet/NN was/VBD ordered/VBN to/TO recapture/VB the/DT system/NN of/IN Eriston/NNP ./. 
On/IN the/DT way/NN ,/, by/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT hazards/NNS of/IN war/NN ,/, the/DT liner/NN carrying/VBG the/DT technicians/NNS was/VBD struck/VBN by/IN a/DT roving/NN mine/NN ./. 
A/DT warship/NN would/MD have/VB survived/VBN ,/, but/CC the/DT liner/NN with/IN its/PRP$ irreplaceable/JJ cargo/NN was/VBD totally/RB destroyed/VBN ./. 
So/IN the/DT operation/NN had/VBD to/TO be/VB abandoned/VBN ./. 
The/DT other/JJ expedition/NN was/VBD ,/, at/IN first/JJ ,/, more/RBR successful/JJ ./. 
There/EX was/VBD no/DT doubt/NN at/IN all/PDT that/IN the/DT Analyzer/NNP fulfilled/VBD its/PRP$ designers/NNS '/POS claims/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT enemy/NN was/VBD heavily/RB defeated/VBN in/IN the/DT first/JJ engagements/NNS ./. 
He/PRP withdrew/VBD ,/, leaving/VBG us/PRP in/IN possession/NN of/IN Saphran/NNP ,/, Leucon/NNP and/CC Hexanerax/NNP ./. 
But/CC his/PRP$ Intelligence/NN Staff/NNP must/MD have/VB noted/VBN the/DT change/NN in/IN our/PRP$ tactics/NNS and/CC the/DT inexplicable/JJ presence/NN of/IN a/DT liner/NN in/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN our/PRP$ battlefleet/NN ./. 
It/PRP must/MD have/VB noted/VBN ,/, also/RB ,/, that/IN our/PRP$ first/JJ fleet/NN had/VBD been/VBN accompanied/VBN by/IN a/DT similar/JJ ship—and/NN had/VBD withdrawn/VBN when/WRB it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN destroyed/VBN ./. 
In/IN the/DT next/JJ engagement/NN ,/, the/DT enemy/NN used/VBD his/PRP$ superior/JJ numbers/NNS to/TO launch/VB an/DT overwhelming/JJ attack/NN on/IN the/DT Analyzer/NNP ship/NN and/CC its/PRP$ unarmed/JJ consort/NN ./. 
The/DT attack/NN was/VBD made/VBN without/IN regard/NN to/TO losses—both/VB ships/NNS were/VBD ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, very/RB heavily/RB protected—and/VB it/PRP succeeded/VBD ./. 
The/DT result/NN was/VBD the/DT virtual/JJ decapitation/NN of/IN the/DT Fleet/NNP ,/, since/IN an/DT effectual/JJ transfer/NN to/TO the/DT old/JJ operational/JJ methods/NNS proved/VBD impossible/JJ ./. 
We/PRP disengaged/VBD under/IN heavy/JJ fire/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB lost/VBD all/DT our/PRP$ gains/NNS and/CC also/RB the/DT systems/NNS of/IN Lormyia/NNP ,/, Ismarnus/NNP ,/, Beronis/NNP ,/, Alphanidon/NNP and/CC Sideneus/NNP ./. 
At/IN this/DT stage/NN ,/, Grand/NNP Admiral/NNP Taxaris/NNP expressed/VBD his/PRP$ disapproval/NN of/IN Norden/NNP by/IN committing/VBG suicide/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP assumed/VBD supreme/JJ command/NN ./. 
The/DT situation/NN was/VBD now/RB both/DT serious/JJ and/CC infuriating/NN ./. 
With/IN stubborn/JJ conservatism/NN and/CC complete/JJ lack/NN of/IN imagination/NN ,/, the/DT enemy/NN continued/VBD to/TO advance/VB with/IN his/PRP$ old-fashioned/JJ and/CC inefficient/JJ but/CC now/RB vastly/RB more/RBR numerous/JJ ships/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD galling/VBG to/TO realize/VB that/IN if/IN we/PRP had/VBD only/RB continued/JJ building/NN ,/, without/IN seeking/VBG new/JJ weapons/NNS ,/, we/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN in/IN a/DT far/RB more/RBR advantageous/JJ position/NN ./. 
There/EX were/VBD many/JJ acrimonious/JJ conferences/NNS at/IN which/WDT Norden/NNP defended/VBD the/DT scientists/NNS while/IN everyone/NN else/RB blamed/VBD them/PRP for/IN all/PDT that/DT had/VBD happened/VBN ./. 
The/DT difficulty/NN was/VBD that/IN Norden/NNP had/VBD proved/VBN every/DT one/CD of/IN his/PRP$ claims/NNS :/: he/PRP had/VBD a/DT perfect/JJ excuse/NN for/IN all/PDT the/DT disasters/NNS that/WDT had/VBD occurred/VBN ./. 
And/CC we/PRP could/MD not/RB now/RB turn/VBP back—the/JJ search/NN for/IN an/DT irresistible/JJ weapon/NN must/MD go/VB on/IN ./. 
At/IN first/JJ it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN a/DT luxury/NN that/WDT would/MD shorten/VB the/DT war/NN ./. 
Now/RB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT necessity/NN if/IN we/PRP were/VBD to/TO end/VB it/PRP victoriously/RB ./. 
We/PRP were/VBD on/IN the/DT defensive/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB was/VBD Norden/NNP ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD more/RBR than/IN ever/RB determined/VBN to/TO reestablish/VB his/PRP$ prestige/NN and/CC that/IN of/IN the/DT Research/NNP Staff/NNP ./. 
But/CC we/PRP had/VBD been/VBN twice/RB disappointed/JJ ,/, and/CC would/MD not/RB make/VB the/DT same/JJ mistake/NN again/RB ./. 
No/DT doubt/NN Norden/NNP 's/POS twenty/NN thousand/NN scientists/NNS would/MD produce/VB many/JJ further/JJ weapons/NNS :/: we/PRP would/MD remain/VB unimpressed/JJ ./. 
We/PRP were/VBD wrong/JJ ./. 
The/DT final/JJ weapon/NN was/VBD something/NN so/RB fantastic/JJ that/IN even/RB now/RB it/PRP seems/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO believe/VB that/IN it/PRP ever/RB existed/VBD ./. 
Its/PRP$ innocent/NN ,/, noncommittal/JJ name—The/JJ Exponential/NNP Field—gave/NNP no/DT hint/NN of/IN its/PRP$ real/JJ potentialities/NNS ./. 
Some/DT of/IN Norden/NNP 's/POS mathematicians/NNS had/VBD discovered/VBN it/PRP during/IN a/DT piece/NN of/IN entirely/RB theoretical/JJ research/NN into/IN the/DT properties/NNS of/IN space/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO everyone/NN 's/POS great/JJ surprise/VBP their/PRP$ results/NNS were/VBD found/VBN to/TO be/VB physically/RB realizable/JJ ./. 
It/PRP seems/VBZ very/RB difficult/JJ to/TO explain/VB the/DT operation/NN of/IN the/DT Field/NNP to/TO the/DT layman/NN ./. 
According/VBG to/TO the/DT technical/JJ description/NN ,/, it/PRP ``/`` produces/VBZ an/DT exponential/JJ condition/NN of/IN space/NN ,/, so/IN that/IN a/DT finite/JJ distance/NN in/IN normal/JJ ,/, linear/JJ space/NN may/MD become/VB infinite/JJ in/IN pseudo-space/NN ./. ''/'' 
Norden/NNP gave/VBD an/DT analogy/NN which/WDT some/DT of/IN us/PRP found/VBD useful/JJ ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD as/IN if/IN one/CD took/VBD a/DT flat/JJ disk/NN of/IN rubber—representing/VBG a/DT region/NN of/IN normal/JJ space—and/NN then/RB pulled/VBD its/PRP$ center/NN out/IN to/TO infinity/NN ./. 
The/DT circumference/NN of/IN the/DT disk/NN would/MD be/VB unaltered—but/JJ its/PRP$ ``/`` diameter/NN ''/'' would/MD be/VB infinite/JJ ./. 
That/DT was/VBD the/DT sort/NN of/IN thing/NN the/DT generator/NN of/IN the/DT Field/NNP did/VBD to/TO the/DT space/NN around/IN it/PRP ./. 
As/IN an/DT example/NN ,/, suppose/VB that/IN a/DT ship/NN carrying/VBG the/DT generator/NN was/VBD surrounded/VBN by/IN a/DT ring/NN of/IN hostile/JJ machines/NNS ./. 
If/IN it/PRP switched/VBD on/IN the/DT Field/NNP ,/, each/DT of/IN the/DT enemy/NN ships/NNS would/MD think/VB that/IN it—and/VBP the/DT ships/NNS on/IN the/DT far/RB side/NN of/IN the/DT circle—had/NN suddenly/RB receded/VBD into/IN nothingness/NN ./. 
Yet/CC the/DT circumference/NN of/IN the/DT circle/NN would/MD be/VB the/DT same/JJ as/IN before/IN :/: only/RB the/DT journey/NN to/TO the/DT center/NN would/MD be/VB of/IN infinite/JJ duration/NN ,/, for/IN as/IN one/CD proceeded/VBD ,/, distances/NNS would/MD appear/VB to/TO become/VB greater/JJR and/CC greater/JJR as/IN the/DT ``/`` scale/JJ ''/'' of/IN space/NN altered/VBN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT nightmare/JJ condition/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT very/RB useful/JJ one/CD ./. 
Nothing/NN could/MD reach/VB a/DT ship/NN carrying/VBG the/DT Field/NN :/: it/PRP might/MD be/VB englobed/VBN by/IN an/DT enemy/NN fleet/NN yet/RB would/MD be/VB as/RB inaccessible/JJ as/IN if/IN it/PRP were/VBD at/IN the/DT other/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT Universe/NNP ./. 
Against/IN this/DT ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, it/PRP could/MD not/RB fight/VB back/RB without/IN switching/VBG off/RP the/DT Field/NNP ,/, but/CC this/DT still/RB left/VBZ it/PRP at/IN a/DT very/RB great/JJ advantage/NN ,/, not/RB only/RB in/IN defense/NN but/CC in/IN offense/NN ./. 
For/IN a/DT ship/NN fitted/VBN with/IN the/DT Field/NNP could/MD approach/VB an/DT enemy/NN fleet/NN undetected/JJ and/CC suddenly/RB appear/VB in/IN its/PRP$ midst/NN ./. 
This/DT time/NN there/RB seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB no/DT flaws/NNS in/IN the/DT new/JJ weapon/NN ./. 
Needless/NN to/TO say/VB ,/, we/PRP looked/VBD for/IN all/PDT the/DT possible/JJ objections/NNS before/IN we/PRP committed/VBD ourselves/PRP again/RB ./. 
Fortunately/RB the/DT equipment/NN was/VBD fairly/RB simple/JJ and/CC did/VBD not/RB require/VB a/DT large/JJ operating/NN staff/NN ./. 
After/IN much/JJ debate/NN ,/, we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO rush/VB it/PRP into/IN production/NN ,/, for/IN we/PRP realized/VBD that/IN time/NN was/VBD running/VBG short/JJ and/CC the/DT war/NN was/VBD going/VBG against/IN us/PRP ./. 
We/PRP had/VBD now/RB lost/VBN about/IN the/DT whole/NN of/IN our/PRP$ initial/JJ gains/NNS and/CC enemy/NN forces/NNS had/VBD made/VBN several/JJ raids/NNS into/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ solar/JJ system/NN ./. 
We/PRP managed/VBD to/TO hold/VB off/RP the/DT enemy/NN while/IN the/DT Fleet/NNP was/VBD reequipped/VBN and/CC the/DT new/JJ battle/NN techniques/NNS were/VBD worked/VBN out/RP ./. 
To/TO use/VB the/DT Field/NNP operationally/RB it/PRP was/VBD necessary/JJ to/TO locate/VB an/DT enemy/NN formation/NN ,/, set/VBD a/DT course/NN that/WDT would/MD intercept/VB it/PRP ,/, and/CC then/RB switch/VB on/IN the/DT generator/NN for/IN the/DT calculated/JJ period/NN of/IN time/NN ./. 
On/IN releasing/VBG the/DT Field/NNP again—if/VBD the/DT calculations/NNS had/VBD been/VBN accurate—one/RB would/MD be/VB in/IN the/DT enemy/NN 's/POS midst/NN and/CC could/MD do/VB great/JJ damage/NN during/IN the/DT resulting/JJ confusion/NN ,/, retreating/VBG by/IN the/DT same/JJ route/NN when/WRB necessary/JJ ./. 
The/DT first/JJ trial/NN maneuvers/NNS proved/VBD satisfactory/JJ and/CC the/DT equipment/NN seemed/VBD quite/RB reliable/JJ ./. 
Numerous/JJ mock/NN attacks/NNS were/VBD made/VBN and/CC the/DT crews/NNS became/VBD accustomed/JJ to/TO the/DT new/JJ technique/NN ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD on/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT test/NN flights/NNS and/CC can/MD vividly/RB remember/VB my/PRP$ impressions/NNS as/IN the/DT Field/NNP was/VBD switched/VBN on/IN ./. 
The/DT ships/NNS around/IN us/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO dwindle/VB as/IN if/IN on/IN the/DT surface/NN of/IN an/DT expanding/VBG bubble/NN :/: in/IN an/DT instant/NN they/PRP had/VBD vanished/VBN completely/RB ./.

The/DT virtual/JJ radius/NN of/IN our/PRP$ pseudo-space/NN was/VBD not/RB really/RB infinite/JJ ,/, but/CC some/DT hundred/CD thousand/CD light-years/NNS ,/, and/CC so/RB the/DT distance/NN to/TO the/DT farthest/JJS stars/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ system/NN had/VBD not/RB been/VBN greatly/RB increased—though/IN the/DT nearest/JJS had/NN of/IN course/NN totally/RB disappeared/VBD ./.

At/IN that/DT moment/NN the/DT enemy/NN made/VBD what/WP was/VBD obviously/RB intended/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT decisive/JJ attack/NN against/IN the/DT fortress/JJ planet/NN of/IN Iton/NNP at/IN the/DT limits/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ Solar/JJ System/NNP ./. 
The/DT Fleet/NNP had/VBD to/TO go/VB into/IN battle/NN before/IN repairs/NNS could/MD be/VB made/VBN ./. 
The/DT enemy/NN must/MD have/VB believed/VBN that/IN we/PRP had/VBD mastered/VBN the/DT secret/NN of/IN invisibility—as/NN in/IN a/DT sense/NN we/PRP had/VBD ./. 
Our/PRP$ ships/NNS appeared/VBD suddenly/RB out/IN of/IN no-where/JJ and/CC inflicted/JJ tremendous/JJ damage—for/NNS a/DT while/NN ./. 
And/CC then/RB something/NN quite/RB baffling/JJ and/CC inexplicable/JJ happened/VBN ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD in/IN command/NN of/IN the/DT flagship/NN Hircania/NNP when/WRB the/DT trouble/NN started/VBD ./. 
We/PRP had/VBD been/VBN operating/VBG as/IN independent/JJ units/NNS ,/, each/DT against/IN assigned/VBN objectives/NNS ./. 
Our/PRP$ detectors/NNS observed/VBD an/DT enemy/NN formation/NN at/IN medium/NN range/NN and/CC the/DT navigating/JJ officers/NNS measured/VBD its/PRP$ distance/NN with/IN great/JJ accuracy/NN ./. 
We/PRP set/VBP course/NN and/CC switched/VBD on/IN the/DT generator/NN ./. 
The/DT Exponential/NNP Field/NNP was/VBD released/VBN at/IN the/DT moment/NN when/WRB we/PRP should/MD have/VB been/VBN passing/VBG through/IN the/DT center/NN of/IN the/DT enemy/NN group/NN ./. 
To/TO our/PRP$ consternation/NN ,/, we/PRP emerged/VBD into/IN normal/JJ space/NN at/IN a/DT distance/NN of/IN many/JJ hundred/CD miles—and/NN when/WRB we/PRP found/VBD the/DT enemy/NN ,/, he/PRP had/VBD already/RB found/VBN us/PRP ./. 
We/PRP retreated/VBD ,/, and/CC tried/VBD again/RB ./. 
This/DT time/NN we/PRP were/VBD so/RB far/RB away/RB from/IN the/DT enemy/NN that/IN he/PRP located/VBD us/PRP first/RB ./. 
Obviously/RB ,/, something/NN was/VBD seriously/RB wrong/JJ ./. 
We/PRP broke/VBD communicator/NN silence/NN and/CC tried/VBD to/TO contact/VB the/DT other/JJ ships/NNS of/IN the/DT Fleet/NNP to/TO see/VB if/IN they/PRP had/VBD experienced/VBN the/DT same/JJ trouble/NN ./. 
Once/RB again/RB we/PRP failed—and/VBP this/DT time/NN the/DT failure/NN was/VBD beyond/IN all/DT reason/NN ,/, for/IN the/DT communication/NN equipment/NN appeared/VBD to/TO be/VB working/VBG perfectly/RB ./. 
We/PRP could/MD only/RB assume/VB ,/, fantastic/JJ though/IN it/PRP seemed/VBD ,/, that/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT Fleet/NNP had/VBD been/VBN destroyed/VBN ./. 
I/PRP do/VBP not/RB wish/VB to/TO describe/VB the/DT scenes/NNS when/WRB the/DT scattered/JJ units/NNS of/IN the/DT Fleet/NNP struggled/VBD back/RB to/TO Base/NNP ./. 
Our/PRP$ casualties/NNS had/VBD actually/RB been/VBN negligible/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT ships/NNS were/VBD completely/RB demoralized/VBN ./. 
Almost/RB all/DT had/VBD lost/VBN touch/RB with/IN one/CD another/DT and/CC had/VBD found/VBN that/IN their/PRP$ ranging/NN equipment/NN showed/VBD inexplicable/JJ errors/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD obvious/JJ that/IN the/DT Exponential/NNP Field/NNP was/VBD the/DT cause/NN of/IN the/DT troubles/NNS ,/, despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP were/VBD only/RB apparent/JJ when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD switched/VBN off/RP ./. 
The/DT explanation/NN came/VBD too/RB late/JJ to/TO do/VB us/PRP any/DT good/JJ ,/, and/CC Norden/NNP 's/POS final/JJ discomfiture/NN was/VBD small/JJ consolation/NN for/IN the/DT virtual/JJ loss/NN of/IN the/DT war/NN ./. 
As/IN I/PRP have/VBP explained/VBN ,/, the/DT Field/NNP generators/NNS produced/VBD a/DT radial/JJ distortion/NN of/IN space/NN ,/, distances/NNS appearing/VBG greater/JJR and/CC greater/JJR as/IN one/CD approached/VBD the/DT center/NN of/IN the/DT artificial/JJ pseudo-space/NN ./. 
When/WRB the/DT Field/NNP was/VBD switched/VBN off/RP ,/, conditions/NNS returned/VBD to/TO normal/JJ ./. 
But/CC not/RB quite/RB ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD never/RB possible/JJ to/TO restore/VB the/DT initial/JJ state/NN exactly/RB ./. 
Switching/VBG the/DT Field/NNP on/IN and/CC off/RP was/VBD equivalent/JJ to/TO an/DT elongation/NN and/CC contraction/NN of/IN the/DT ship/NN carrying/VBG the/DT generator/NN ,/, but/CC there/RB was/VBD a/DT hysteretic/JJ effect/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP were/VBD ,/, and/CC the/DT initial/JJ condition/NN was/VBD never/RB quite/RB reproducible/JJ ,/, owing/VBG to/TO all/PDT the/DT thousands/NNS of/IN electrical/JJ changes/NNS and/CC movements/NNS of/IN mass/NN aboard/IN the/DT ship/NN while/IN the/DT Field/NNP was/VBD on/IN ./. 
These/DT asymmetries/NNS and/CC distortions/NNS were/VBD cumulative/JJ ,/, and/CC though/IN they/PRP seldom/RB amounted/VBD to/TO more/JJR than/IN a/DT fraction/NN of/IN one/CD per/IN cent/NN ,/, that/WDT was/VBD quite/RB enough/RB ./. 
It/PRP meant/VBD that/IN the/DT precision/NN ranging/VBG equipment/NN and/CC the/DT tuned/JJ circuits/NNS in/IN the/DT communication/NN apparatus/NN were/VBD thrown/VBN completely/RB out/IN of/IN adjustment/NN ./. 
Any/DT single/JJ ship/NN could/MD never/RB detect/VB the/DT change—only/NN when/WRB it/PRP compared/VBN its/PRP$ equipment/NN with/IN that/DT of/IN another/DT vessel/NN ,/, or/CC tried/VBD to/TO communicate/VB with/IN it/PRP ,/, could/MD it/PRP tell/VB what/WP had/VBD happened/VBN ./. 
It/PRP is/VBZ impossible/JJ to/TO describe/VB the/DT resultant/JJ chaos/NN ./. 
Not/RB a/DT single/JJ component/NN of/IN one/CD ship/NN could/MD be/VB expected/VBN with/IN certainty/NN to/TO work/VB aboard/RB another/DT ./. 
The/DT very/RB nuts/JJ and/CC bolts/NNS were/VBD no/RB longer/RBR interchangeable/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT supply/NN position/NN became/VBD quite/RB impossible/JJ ./. 
Given/VBN time/NN ,/, we/PRP might/MD even/RB have/VB overcome/VBN these/DT difficulties/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT enemy/JJ ships/NNS were/VBD already/RB attacking/VBG in/IN thousands/NNS with/IN weapons/NNS which/WDT now/RB seemed/VBD centuries/NNS behind/IN those/DT that/IN we/PRP had/VBD invented/VBN ./. 
Our/PRP$ magnificent/JJ Fleet/NNP ,/, crippled/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ science/NN ,/, fought/VBN on/IN as/IN best/NN it/PRP could/MD until/IN it/PRP was/VBD overwhelmed/VBN and/CC forced/VBN to/TO surrender/VB ./. 
The/DT ships/NNS fitted/VBN with/IN the/DT Field/NNP were/VBD still/RB invulnerable/JJ ,/, but/CC as/IN fighting/VBG units/NNS they/PRP were/VBD almost/RB helpless/JJ ./. 
Every/DT time/NN they/PRP switched/VBD on/IN their/PRP$ generators/NNS to/TO escape/VB from/IN enemy/JJ attack/NN ,/, the/DT permanent/JJ distortion/NN of/IN their/PRP$ equipment/NN increased/VBN ./. 
In/IN a/DT month/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD all/DT over/IN ./. 
THIS/NNP IS/VBZ THE/NNP true/JJ story/NN of/IN our/PRP$ defeat/NN ,/, which/WDT I/PRP give/VBP without/IN prejudice/NN to/TO my/PRP$ defense/NN before/IN this/DT Court/NNP ./.

They/PRP spoke/VBD of/IN her/PRP as/IN a/DT contestant/NN or/CC a/DT place/NN or/CC even/RB an/DT enemy/NN ./. 
But/CC the/DT old/JJ man/NN always/RB thought/VBD of/IN her/PRP as/IN feminine/NN and/CC as/IN something/NN that/WDT gave/VBD or/CC withheld/JJ great/JJ favours/NNS ,/, and/CC if/IN she/PRP did/VBD wild/VB or/CC wicked/JJ things/NNS it/PRP was/VBD because/IN she/PRP could/MD not/RB help/VB them/PRP ./. 
The/DT moon/NN affects/VBZ her/PRP as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ a/DT woman/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./.

He/PRP was/VBD letting/VBG the/DT current/JJ do/VBP a/DT third/NN of/IN the/DT work/NN and/CC as/IN it/PRP started/VBD to/TO be/VB light/JJ he/PRP saw/VBD he/PRP was/VBD already/RB further/RB out/RB than/IN he/PRP had/VBD hoped/VBN to/TO be/VB at/IN this/DT hour/NN ./. 
I/PRP worked/VBD the/DT deep/JJ wells/NNS for/IN a/DT week/NN and/CC did/VBD nothing/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Today/NN I/PRP 'll/MD work/VB out/RB where/WRB the/DT schools/NNS of/IN bonita/NN and/CC albacore/NN are/VBP and/CC maybe/RB there/EX will/MD be/VB a/DT big/JJ one/NN with/IN them/PRP ./. 
Before/IN it/PRP was/VBD really/RB light/JJ he/PRP had/VBD his/PRP$ baits/NNS out/RP and/CC was/VBD drifting/VBG with/IN the/DT current/JJ ./. 
One/CD bait/NN was/VBD down/RB forty/JJ fathoms/NNS ./. 
The/DT second/NN was/VBD at/IN seventy-five/JJ and/CC the/DT third/JJ and/CC fourth/JJ were/VBD down/RB in/IN the/DT blue/JJ water/NN at/IN one/CD hundred/CD and/CC one/CD hundred/CD and/CC twenty-five/JJ fathoms/NNS ./. 
Each/DT bait/NN hung/NN head/VBP down/IN with/IN the/DT shank/NN of/IN the/DT hook/NN inside/IN the/DT bait/NN fish/NN ,/, tied/VBN and/CC sewed/VBN solid/JJ and/CC all/PDT the/DT projecting/VBG part/NN of/IN the/DT hook/NN ,/, the/DT curve/NN and/CC the/DT point/NN ,/, was/VBD covered/VBN with/IN fresh/JJ sardines/NNS ./. 
Each/DT sardine/NN was/VBD hooked/VBN through/IN both/DT eyes/NNS so/IN that/IN they/PRP made/VBD a/DT half-garland/NN on/IN the/DT projecting/NN steel/NN ./. 
There/EX was/VBD no/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT hook/NN that/IN a/DT great/JJ fish/NN could/MD feel/VB which/WDT was/VBD not/RB sweet/JJ smelling/NN and/CC good/JJ tasting/NN ./. 
The/DT boy/NN had/VBD given/VBN him/PRP two/CD fresh/JJ small/JJ tunas/NNS ,/, or/CC albacores/NNS ,/, which/WDT hung/VBP on/IN the/DT two/CD deepest/JJS lines/NNS like/IN plummets/NNS and/CC ,/, on/IN the/DT others/NNS ,/, he/PRP had/VBD a/DT big/JJ blue/NN runner/NN and/CC a/DT yellow/JJ jack/NN that/WDT had/VBD been/VBN used/VBN before/IN ;/: but/CC they/PRP were/VBD in/IN good/JJ condition/NN still/RB and/CC had/VBD the/DT excellent/JJ sardines/NNS to/TO give/VB them/PRP scent/NN and/CC attractiveness/NN ./. 
Each/DT line/NN ,/, as/IN thick/JJ around/IN as/IN a/DT big/JJ pencil/NN ,/, was/VBD looped/VBN onto/IN a/DT green-sapped/JJ stick/NN so/IN that/IN any/DT pull/NN or/CC touch/NN on/IN the/DT bait/NN would/MD make/VB the/DT stick/NN dip/NN and/CC each/DT line/NN had/VBD two/CD forty-fathom/NN coils/NNS which/WDT could/MD be/VB made/VBN fast/RB to/TO the/DT other/JJ spare/NN coils/NNS so/RB that/IN ,/, if/IN it/PRP were/VBD necessary/JJ ,/, a/DT fish/NN could/MD take/VB out/RP over/IN three/CD hundred/VBD fathoms/NNS of/IN line/NN ./. 
Now/RB the/DT man/NN watched/VBD the/DT dip/NN of/IN the/DT three/CD sticks/NNS over/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT skiff/NN and/CC rowed/VBD gently/RB to/TO keep/VB the/DT lines/NNS straight/VBD up/RB and/CC down/RB and/CC at/IN their/PRP$ proper/JJ depths/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD quite/RB light/JJ and/CC any/DT moment/NN now/RB the/DT sun/NN would/MD rise/VB ./. 
The/DT sun/NN rose/VBD thinly/RB from/IN the/DT sea/NN and/CC the/DT old/JJ man/NN could/MD see/VB the/DT other/JJ boats/NNS ,/, low/JJ on/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC well/RB in/IN toward/IN the/DT shore/NN ,/, spread/VBD out/RP across/IN the/DT current/JJ ./. 
Then/RB the/DT sun/NN was/VBD brighter/NN and/CC the/DT glare/NN came/VBD on/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC then/RB ,/, as/IN it/PRP rose/VBD clear/JJ ,/, the/DT flat/JJ sea/NN sent/VBD it/PRP back/RP at/IN his/PRP$ eyes/NNS so/IN that/IN it/PRP hurt/VBD sharply/RB and/CC he/PRP rowed/VBD without/IN looking/VBG into/IN it/PRP ./. 
He/PRP looked/VBD down/RB into/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC watched/VBD the/DT lines/NNS that/WDT went/VBD straight/RB down/RB into/IN the/DT dark/NN of/IN the/DT water/NN ./. 
He/PRP kept/VBD them/PRP straighter/JJR than/IN anyone/NN did/VBD ,/, so/IN that/DT at/IN each/DT level/NN in/IN the/DT darkness/NN of/IN the/DT stream/NN there/EX would/MD be/VB a/DT bait/NN waiting/VBG exactly/RB where/WRB he/PRP wished/VBD it/PRP to/TO be/VB for/IN any/DT fish/NN that/IN swam/NN there/RB ./. 
Others/NNS let/VBP them/PRP drift/VB with/IN the/DT current/JJ and/CC sometimes/RB they/PRP were/VBD at/IN sixty/NN fathoms/NNS when/WRB the/DT fishermen/NNS thought/VBD they/PRP were/VBD at/IN a/DT hundred/CD ./. 
But/CC ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ,/, I/PRP keep/VBP them/PRP with/IN precision/NN ./. 
Only/RB I/PRP have/VBP no/DT luck/NN any/DT more/JJR ./. 
But/CC who/WP knows/VBZ ?/.

It/PRP is/VBZ better/RBR to/TO be/VB lucky/JJ ./. 
But/CC I/PRP would/MD rather/RB be/VB exact/JJ ./. 
Then/RB when/WRB luck/NN comes/VBZ you/PRP are/VBP ready/JJ ./. 
The/DT sun/NN was/VBD two/CD hours/NNS higher/RBR now/RB and/CC it/PRP did/VBD not/RB hurt/VB his/PRP$ eyes/NNS so/RB much/JJ to/TO look/VB into/IN the/DT east/NN ./.

All/DT my/PRP$ life/NN the/DT early/JJ sun/NN has/VBZ hurt/VBN my/PRP$ eyes/NNS ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./.

In/IN the/DT evening/NN I/PRP can/MD look/VB straight/RB into/IN it/PRP without/IN getting/VBG the/DT blackness/NN ./. 
It/PRP has/VBZ more/JJR force/NN in/IN the/DT evening/NN too/RB ./. 
But/CC in/IN the/DT morning/NN it/PRP is/VBZ painful/JJ ./. 
Just/RB then/RB he/PRP saw/VBD a/DT man-of-war/JJ bird/NN with/IN his/PRP$ long/JJ black/JJ wings/NNS circling/VBG in/IN the/DT sky/NN ahead/RB of/IN him/PRP ./. 
He/PRP made/VBD a/DT quick/JJ drop/NN ,/, slanting/VBG down/RP on/IN his/PRP$ back-swept/JJ wings/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB circled/VBD again/RB ./. 
``/`` He/PRP 's/VBZ got/VBD something/NN ,/, ''/'' the/DT old/JJ man/NN said/VBD aloud/JJ ./.

He/PRP did/VBD not/RB hurry/VB and/CC he/PRP kept/VBD his/PRP$ lines/NNS straight/VBD up/RB and/CC down/RB ./. 
But/CC he/PRP crowded/VBD the/DT current/JJ a/DT little/JJ so/RB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD still/RB fishing/VBG correctly/RB though/IN faster/JJR than/IN he/PRP would/MD have/VB fished/VBN if/IN he/PRP was/VBD not/RB trying/VBG to/TO use/VB the/DT bird/NN ./. 
The/DT bird/NN went/VBD higher/JJR in/IN the/DT air/NN and/CC circled/VBD again/RB ,/, his/PRP$ wings/NNS motionless/NN ./. 
Then/RB he/PRP dove/VB suddenly/RB and/CC the/DT old/JJ man/NN saw/VBD flying/VBG fish/JJ spurt/VBN out/IN of/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC sail/NN desperately/RB over/IN the/DT surface/NN ./. 
``/`` Dolphin/NNP ,/, ''/'' the/DT old/JJ man/NN said/VBD aloud/JJ ./.

He/PRP shipped/VBD his/PRP$ oars/NNS and/CC brought/VBD a/DT small/JJ line/NN from/IN under/IN the/DT bow/NN ./. 
It/PRP had/VBD a/DT wire/NN leader/NN and/CC a/DT medium-sized/JJ hook/NN and/CC he/PRP baited/VBD it/PRP with/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT sardines/NNS ./. 
He/PRP let/VB it/PRP go/VB over/IN the/DT side/NN and/CC then/RB made/VBD it/PRP fast/VBZ to/TO a/DT ring/NN bolt/NN in/IN the/DT stern/NN ./.

As/IN he/PRP watched/VBD the/DT bird/NN dipped/VBD again/RB slanting/VBG his/PRP$ wings/NNS for/IN the/DT dive/NN and/CC then/RB swinging/VBG them/PRP wildly/RB and/CC ineffectually/RB as/IN he/PRP followed/VBD the/DT flying/VBG fish/NN ./. 
The/DT old/JJ man/NN could/MD see/VB the/DT slight/JJ bulge/NN in/IN the/DT water/NN that/IN the/DT big/JJ dolphin/NN raised/VBD as/IN they/PRP followed/VBD the/DT escaping/VBG fish/NN ./.

That/DT school/NN has/VBZ gotten/VBN away/RP from/IN me/PRP ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./.

The/DT clouds/NN over/IN the/DT land/NN now/RB rose/VBD like/IN mountains/NNS and/CC the/DT coast/NN was/VBD only/RB a/DT long/JJ green/JJ line/NN with/IN the/DT gray/JJ blue/NN hills/NNS behind/IN it/PRP ./. 
The/DT water/NN was/VBD a/DT dark/JJ blue/NN now/RB ,/, so/RB dark/JJ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD almost/RB purple/JJ ./.

You/PRP must/MD do/VB nothing/NN stupid/NN ./.

No/DT one/NN should/MD be/VB alone/RB in/IN their/PRP$ old/JJ age/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./.

I/PRP must/MD remember/VB to/TO eat/VB the/DT tuna/NN before/IN he/PRP spoils/VBZ in/IN order/NN to/TO keep/VB strong/JJ ./.

During/IN the/DT night/NN two/CD porpoise/NN came/VBD around/IN the/DT boat/NN and/CC he/PRP could/MD hear/VB them/PRP rolling/VBG and/CC blowing/NN ./.

``/`` They/PRP are/VBP good/JJ ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ./. 
``/`` They/PRP play/VBP and/CC make/VBP jokes/NNS and/CC love/VB one/CD another/DT ./. 
They/PRP are/VBP our/PRP$ brothers/NNS like/IN the/DT flying/VBG fish/NN ./. ''/'' 
Then/RB he/PRP began/VBD to/TO pity/VB the/DT great/JJ fish/NN that/IN he/PRP had/VBD hooked/VBN ./. 
He/PRP is/VBZ wonderful/JJ and/CC strange/JJ and/CC who/WP knows/VBZ how/WRB old/JJ he/PRP is/VBZ ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Never/RB have/VBP I/PRP had/VBD such/PDT a/DT strong/JJ fish/NN nor/CC one/CD who/WP acted/VBD so/RB strangely/RB ./. 
Perhaps/RB he/PRP is/VBZ too/RB wise/JJ to/TO jump/VB ./. 
He/PRP could/MD ruin/VB me/PRP by/IN jumping/VBG or/CC by/IN a/DT wild/JJ rush/NN ./. 
But/CC perhaps/RB he/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN hooked/VBN many/JJ times/NNS before/RB and/CC he/PRP knows/VBZ that/IN this/DT is/VBZ how/WRB he/PRP should/MD make/VB his/PRP$ fight/NN ./.

But/CC what/WP a/DT great/JJ fish/NN he/PRP is/VBZ and/CC what/WP he/PRP will/MD bring/VB in/IN the/DT market/NN if/IN the/DT flesh/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./. 
He/PRP took/VBD the/DT bait/NN like/IN a/DT male/NN and/CC he/PRP pulls/VBZ like/IN a/DT male/NN and/CC his/PRP$ fight/NN has/VBZ no/DT panic/NN in/IN it/PRP ./. 
I/PRP wonder/VBP if/IN he/PRP has/VBZ any/DT plans/NNS or/CC if/IN he/PRP is/VBZ just/RB as/RB desperate/JJ as/IN I/PRP am/VBP ?/. 
He/PRP remembered/VBD the/DT time/NN he/PRP had/VBD hooked/VBN one/CD of/IN a/DT pair/NN of/IN marlin/NN ./. 
The/DT male/JJ fish/NN always/RB let/VB the/DT female/JJ fish/NN feed/NN first/RB and/CC the/DT hooked/JJ fish/NN ,/, the/DT female/NN ,/, made/VBD a/DT wild/JJ ,/, panic-stricken/JJ ,/, despairing/VBG fight/NN that/WDT soon/RB exhausted/VBD her/PRP ,/, and/CC all/PDT the/DT time/NN the/DT male/NN had/VBD stayed/VBN with/IN her/PRP ,/, crossing/VBG the/DT line/NN and/CC circling/VBG with/IN her/PRP on/IN the/DT surface/NN ./. 
He/PRP had/VBD stayed/VBN so/RB close/JJ that/IN the/DT old/JJ man/NN was/VBD afraid/JJ he/PRP would/MD cut/VB the/DT line/NN with/IN his/PRP$ tail/NN which/WDT was/VBD sharp/JJ as/IN a/DT scythe/NN and/CC almost/RB of/IN that/DT size/NN and/CC shape/NN ./. 
When/WRB the/DT old/JJ man/NN had/VBD gaffed/VBN her/PRP$ and/CC clubbed/VBD her/PRP ,/, holding/VBG the/DT rapier/JJR bill/NN with/IN its/PRP$ sandpaper/NN edge/NN and/CC clubbing/VBG her/PRP$ across/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN her/PRP$ head/NN until/IN her/PRP$ colour/NNS turned/VBD to/TO a/DT colour/NN almost/RB like/IN the/DT backing/NN of/IN mirrors/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT boy/NN 's/POS aid/NN ,/, hoisted/VBD her/PRP aboard/NN ,/, the/DT male/NN fish/NN had/VBD stayed/VBN by/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT boat/NN ./. 
Then/RB ,/, while/IN the/DT old/JJ man/NN was/VBD clearing/VBG the/DT lines/NNS and/CC preparing/VBG the/DT harpoon/NN ,/, the/DT male/JJ fish/NN jumped/VBD high/JJ into/IN the/DT air/NN beside/IN the/DT boat/NN to/TO see/VB where/WRB the/DT female/NN was/VBD and/CC then/RB went/VBD down/RB deep/RB ,/, his/PRP$ lavender/NN wings/NNS ,/, that/WDT were/VBD his/PRP$ pectoral/JJ fins/NNS ,/, spread/JJ wide/JJ and/CC all/DT his/PRP$ wide/JJ lavender/NN stripes/NNS showing/VBG ./. 
He/PRP was/VBD beautiful/JJ ,/, the/DT old/JJ man/NN remembered/VBD ,/, and/CC he/PRP had/VBD stayed/VBN ./. 
That/DT was/VBD the/DT saddest/JJS thing/NN I/PRP ever/RB saw/VBD with/IN them/PRP ,/, the/DT old/JJ man/NN thought/NN ./. 
The/DT boy/NN was/VBD sad/JJ too/RB and/CC we/PRP begged/VBD her/PRP pardon/NN and/CC butchered/VBD her/PRP$ promptly/NN ./. 
``/`` I/PRP wish/VBP the/DT boy/NN was/VBD here/RB ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD aloud/JJ and/CC settled/VBD himself/PRP against/IN the/DT rounded/JJ planks/NNS of/IN the/DT bow/NN and/CC felt/VBD the/DT strength/NN of/IN the/DT great/JJ fish/NN through/IN the/DT line/NN he/PRP held/VBD across/IN his/PRP$ shoulders/NNS moving/VBG steadily/RB toward/IN whatever/WDT he/PRP had/VBD chosen/VBN ./. 
When/WRB once/RB ,/, through/IN my/PRP$ treachery/NN ,/, it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN necessary/JJ to/TO him/PRP to/TO make/VB a/DT choice/NN ,/, the/DT old/JJ man/NN thought/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ choice/NN had/VBD been/VBN to/TO stay/VB in/IN the/DT deep/JJ dark/NN water/NN far/RB out/RP beyond/IN all/DT snares/NNS and/CC traps/NNS and/CC treacheries/NNS ./. 
My/PRP$ choice/NN was/VBD to/TO go/VB there/RB to/TO find/VB him/PRP beyond/IN all/DT people/NNS ./. 
Beyond/IN all/DT people/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ./. 
Now/RB we/PRP are/VBP joined/VBN together/RB and/CC have/VBP been/VBN since/IN noon/NN ./. 
And/CC no/DT one/NN to/TO help/VB either/DT one/CD of/IN us/PRP ./. 
Perhaps/RB I/PRP should/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN a/DT fisherman/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
But/CC that/DT was/VBD the/DT thing/NN that/IN I/PRP was/VBD born/VBN for/IN ./. 
I/PRP must/MD surely/RB remember/VB to/TO eat/VB the/DT tuna/NN after/IN it/PRP gets/VBZ light/JJ ./. 
Some/DT time/NN before/IN daylight/JJ something/NN took/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT baits/NNS that/WDT were/VBD behind/IN him/PRP ./. 
He/PRP heard/VBD the/DT stick/JJ break/NN and/CC the/DT line/NN begin/NN to/TO rush/VB out/RP over/IN the/DT gunwale/NN of/IN the/DT skiff/NN ./. 
In/IN the/DT darkness/NN he/PRP loosened/VBD his/PRP$ sheath/NN knife/NN and/CC taking/VBG all/PDT the/DT strain/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN on/IN his/PRP$ left/JJ shoulder/NN he/PRP leaned/VBD back/RB and/CC cut/VBD the/DT line/NN against/IN the/DT wood/NN of/IN the/DT gunwale/NN ./. 
Then/RB he/PRP cut/VBD the/DT other/JJ line/NN closest/JJS to/TO him/PRP and/CC in/IN the/DT dark/NN made/VBD the/DT loose/JJ ends/NNS of/IN the/DT reserve/NN coils/VBZ fast/RB ./. 
He/PRP worked/VBD skillfully/RB with/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN and/CC put/VB his/PRP$ foot/NN on/IN the/DT coils/NNS to/TO hold/VB them/PRP as/IN he/PRP drew/VBD his/PRP$ knots/NNS tight/VBD ./. 
Now/RB he/PRP had/VBD six/CD reserve/NN coils/NNS of/IN line/NN ./. 
There/EX were/VBD two/CD from/IN each/DT bait/NN he/PRP had/VBD severed/VBN and/CC the/DT two/CD from/IN the/DT bait/NN the/DT fish/NN had/VBD taken/VBN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD all/DT connected/VBN ./. 
After/IN it/PRP is/VBZ light/JJ ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ,/, I/PRP will/MD work/VB back/RB to/TO the/DT forty-fathom/JJ bait/NN and/CC cut/VB it/PRP away/RB too/RB and/CC link/VB up/RP the/DT reserve/NN coils/NNS ./. 
I/PRP will/MD have/VB lost/VBN two/CD hundred/JJ fathoms/NNS of/IN good/JJ Catalan/NNP cordel/NN and/CC the/DT hooks/NNS and/CC leaders/NNS ./. 
That/DT can/MD be/VB replaced/VBN ./. 
But/CC who/WP replaces/VBZ this/DT fish/JJ if/IN I/PRP hook/VBP some/DT fish/NN and/CC it/PRP cuts/VBZ him/PRP off/RP ?/. 
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP that/IN fish/NN was/VBD that/IN took/VBD the/DT bait/NN just/RB now/RB ./. 
It/PRP could/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT marlin/NN or/CC a/DT broadbill/NN or/CC a/DT shark/NN ./. 
I/PRP never/RB felt/VBD him/PRP ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD to/TO get/VB rid/JJ of/IN him/PRP too/RB fast/RB ./. 
Aloud/NNP he/PRP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP had/VBD the/DT boy/NN ./. ''/'' 
But/CC you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB got/VBD the/DT boy/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
You/PRP have/VBP only/RB yourself/PRP and/CC you/PRP had/VBD better/JJR work/NN back/RB to/TO the/DT last/JJ line/NN now/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT dark/NN or/CC not/RB in/IN the/DT dark/NN ,/, and/CC cut/VBD it/PRP away/RB and/CC hook/VB up/RP the/DT two/CD reserve/NN coils/NNS ./. 
So/RB he/PRP did/VBD it/PRP ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD difficult/JJ in/IN the/DT dark/NN and/CC once/RB the/DT fish/NN made/VBD a/DT surge/NN that/WDT pulled/VBD him/PRP down/RP on/IN his/PRP$ face/NN and/CC made/VBD a/DT cut/NN below/IN his/PRP$ eye/NN ./. 
The/DT blood/NN ran/VBD down/RP his/PRP$ cheek/NN a/DT little/JJ way/NN ./. 
But/CC it/PRP coagulated/VBD and/CC dried/VBD before/IN it/PRP reached/VBD his/PRP$ chin/NN and/CC he/PRP worked/VBD his/PRP$ way/NN back/RB to/TO the/DT bow/NN and/CC rested/VBN against/IN the/DT wood/NN ./. 
He/PRP adjusted/VBD the/DT sack/NN and/CC carefully/RB worked/VBD the/DT line/NN so/IN that/IN it/PRP came/VBD across/IN a/DT new/JJ part/NN of/IN his/PRP$ shoulders/NNS and/CC ,/, holding/VBG it/PRP anchored/VBD with/IN his/PRP$ shoulders/NNS ,/, he/PRP carefully/RB felt/VBD the/DT pull/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN and/CC then/RB felt/VBD with/IN his/PRP$ hand/NN the/DT progress/NN of/IN the/DT skiff/NN through/IN the/DT water/NN ./. 
I/PRP wonder/VBP what/WP he/PRP made/VBD that/IN lurch/NN for/IN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
The/DT wire/NN must/MD have/VB slipped/VBN on/IN the/DT great/JJ hill/NN of/IN his/PRP$ back/NN ./. 
Certainly/RB his/PRP$ back/NN can/MD not/RB feel/VB as/RB badly/RB as/IN mine/NN does/VBZ ./. 
But/CC he/PRP can/MD not/RB pull/VB this/DT skiff/NN forever/RB ,/, no/DT matter/NN how/WRB great/JJ he/PRP is/VBZ ./. 
Now/RB everything/NN is/VBZ cleared/VBN away/RP that/IN might/MD make/VB trouble/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP a/DT big/JJ reserve/NN of/IN line/NN ;/: all/PDT that/IN a/DT man/NN can/MD ask/VB ./. 
``/`` Fish/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD softly/RB ,/, aloud/NN ,/, ``/`` I/PRP 'll/MD stay/VB with/IN you/PRP until/IN I/PRP am/VBP dead/JJ ./. ''/'' 
He/PRP 'll/MD stay/VB with/IN me/PRP too/RB ,/, I/PRP suppose/VBP ,/, the/DT old/JJ man/NN thought/NN and/CC he/PRP waited/VBD for/IN it/PRP to/TO be/VB light/JJ ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD cold/VBN now/RB in/IN the/DT time/NN before/IN daylight/NN and/CC he/PRP pushed/VBD against/IN the/DT wood/NN to/TO be/VB warm/JJ ./. 
I/PRP can/MD do/VB it/PRP as/RB long/RB as/IN he/PRP can/MD ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
And/CC in/IN the/DT first/JJ light/VBD the/DT line/NN extended/VBN out/IN and/CC down/RB into/IN the/DT water/NN ./. 
The/DT boat/NN moved/VBD steadily/RB and/CC when/WRB the/DT first/JJ edge/NN of/IN the/DT sun/NN rose/VBD it/PRP was/VBD on/IN the/DT old/JJ man/NN 's/POS right/JJ shoulder/NN ./. 
``/`` He/PRP 's/VBZ headed/VBN north/RB ,/, ''/'' the/DT old/JJ man/NN said/VBD ./. 
The/DT current/JJ will/MD have/VB set/VBN us/PRP far/RB to/TO the/DT eastward/NN ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
I/PRP wish/VBP he/PRP would/MD turn/VB with/IN the/DT current/JJ ./. 
That/DT would/MD show/VB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD tiring/VBG ./. 
When/WRB the/DT sun/NN had/VBD risen/VBN further/RB the/DT old/JJ man/NN realized/VBD that/IN the/DT fish/NN was/VBD not/RB tiring/VBG ./. 
There/EX was/VBD only/RB one/CD favorable/JJ sign/NN ./. 
The/DT slant/NN of/IN the/DT line/NN showed/VBD he/PRP was/VBD swimming/VBG at/IN a/DT lesser/JJR depth/NN ./. 
That/DT did/VBD not/RB necessarily/RB mean/VB that/IN he/PRP would/MD jump/VB ./. 
But/CC he/PRP might/MD ./. 
``/`` God/NNP let/VBD him/PRP jump/VB ,/, ''/'' the/DT old/JJ man/NN said/VBD ./. 
``/`` I/PRP have/VBP enough/JJ line/NN to/TO handle/VB him/PRP ./. ''/'' 
Maybe/RB if/IN I/PRP can/MD increase/VB the/DT tension/NN just/RB a/DT little/JJ it/PRP will/MD hurt/VB him/PRP and/CC he/PRP will/MD jump/VB ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Now/RB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ daylight/JJ let/NN him/PRP jump/VB so/RB that/IN he/PRP 'll/MD fill/VB the/DT sacks/NNS along/IN his/PRP$ backbone/NN with/IN air/NN and/CC then/RB he/PRP can/MD not/RB go/VB deep/RB to/TO die/VB ./. 
He/PRP tried/VBD to/TO increase/VB the/DT tension/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT line/NN had/VBD been/VBN taut/VBN up/RP to/TO the/DT very/RB edge/NN of/IN the/DT breaking/NN point/NN since/IN he/PRP had/VBD hooked/VBN the/DT fish/NN and/CC he/PRP felt/VBD the/DT harshness/NN as/IN he/PRP leaned/VBD back/RB to/TO pull/VB and/CC knew/VB he/PRP could/MD put/VB no/DT more/JJR strain/NN on/IN it/PRP ./. 
I/PRP must/MD not/RB jerk/VB it/PRP ever/RB ,/, he/PRP thought/VBD ./. 
Each/DT jerk/NN widens/VBZ the/DT cut/NN the/DT hook/NN makes/VBZ and/CC then/RB when/WRB he/PRP does/VBZ jump/VB he/PRP might/MD throw/VB it/PRP ./. 
Anyway/RB I/PRP feel/VBP better/RB with/IN the/DT sun/NN and/CC for/IN once/RB I/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB to/TO look/VB into/IN it/PRP ./. 
There/EX was/VBD yellow/JJ weed/NN on/IN the/DT line/NN but/CC the/DT old/JJ man/NN knew/VBD that/IN only/RB made/VBD an/DT added/JJ drag/NN and/CC he/PRP was/VBD pleased/JJ ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD the/DT yellow/JJ Gulf/NNP weed/NN that/WDT had/VBD made/VBN so/RB much/JJ phosphorescence/NN in/IN the/DT night/NN ./. 
``/`` Fish/NN ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` I/PRP love/VBP you/PRP and/CC respect/VB you/PRP very/RB much/RB ./.

A/DT small/JJ bird/NN came/VBD toward/IN the/DT skiff/NN from/IN the/DT north/NN ./.

We/PRP sat/VBD late/RB ,/, listening/VBG to/TO his/PRP$ complaints/NNS ,/, and/CC making/VBG many/JJ little/JJ arrangements/NNS for/IN the/DT future/NN ./. 
The/DT next/JJ morning/NN early/JJ I/PRP departed/VBD ./.

The/DT next/JJ morning/NN I/PRP delivered/VBD my/PRP$ letters/NNS of/IN introduction/NN ,/, and/CC paid/VBD a/DT visit/NN to/TO some/DT of/IN the/DT principal/JJ professors/NNS ,/, and/CC among/IN others/NNS to/TO M./NNP Krempe/NNP ,/, professor/NN of/IN natural/JJ philoso-/JJ phy/NN ./. 
He/PRP received/VBD me/PRP with/IN politeness/NN ,/, and/CC asked/VBD me/PRP several/JJ questions/NNS concerning/VBG my/PRP$ progress/NN in/IN the/DT different/JJ branches/NNS of/IN science/NN appertaining/VBG to/TO natural/JJ philosophy/NN ./. 
I/PRP mentioned/VBD ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, with/IN fear/NN and/CC trembling/NN ,/, the/DT only/JJ authors/NNS I/PRP had/VBD ever/RB read/VBN upon/IN those/DT subjects/NNS ./. 
The/DT professor/NN stared/VBD :/: ``/`` Have/VBP you/PRP ,/, ''/'' he/PRP said/VBD ,/, ``/`` really/RB spent/VB your/PRP$ time/NN in/IN studying/VBG such/JJ nonsense/NN ?/. ''/''

I/PRP returned/VBD home/NN ,/, not/RB disappointed/JJ ,/, for/IN I/PRP had/VBD long/JJ con-/JJ sidered/VBN those/DT authors/NNS useless/VBP whom/WP the/DT professor/NN had/VBD so/RB strongly/RB reprobated/VBN ;/: but/CC I/PRP did/VBD not/RB feel/VB much/RB inclined/VBN to/TO study/VB the/DT books/NNS which/WDT I/PRP procured/VBD at/IN his/PRP$ recommendation/NN ./. 
M./NNP Krempe/NNP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ squat/JJ man/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT gruff/JJ voice/NN and/CC repul-/JJ sive/JJ countenance/NN ;/: the/DT teacher/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, did/VBD not/RB prepossess/VB me/PRP in/IN favour/NN of/IN his/PRP$ doctrine/NN ./. 
Besides/IN ,/, I/PRP had/VBD a/DT contempt/NN for/IN the/DT uses/NNS of/IN modern/JJ natural/JJ philosophy/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD very/RB differ-/JJ ent/NN ,/, when/WRB the/DT masters/NNS of/IN the/DT science/NN sought/VBD immortality/NN and/CC power/NN ;/: such/JJ views/NNS ,/, although/IN futile/NN ,/, were/VBD grand/JJ :/: but/CC now/RB the/DT scene/NN was/VBD changed/VBN ./. 
The/DT ambition/NN of/IN the/DT inquirer/NN seemed/VBD to/TO limit/VB itself/PRP to/TO the/DT annihilation/NN of/IN those/DT visions/NNS on/IN which/WDT my/PRP$ interest/NN in/IN science/NN was/VBD chiefly/NN founded/VBN ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD required/VBN to/TO exchange/VB chimeras/NNS of/IN boundless/NN grandeur/NN for/IN realities/NNS of/IN little/JJ worth/NN ./. 
Partly/RB from/IN curiosity/NN ,/, and/CC partly/RB from/IN idleness/NN ,/, I/PRP went/VBD into/IN the/DT lecturing/NN room/NN ,/, which/WDT M./NNP Waldman/NNP entered/VBD shortly/RB after/IN ./. 
This/DT professor/NN was/VBD very/RB unlike/IN his/PRP$ colleague/NN ./. 
He/PRP appeared/VBD about/IN fifty/JJ years/NNS of/IN age/NN ,/, but/CC with/IN an/DT aspect/JJ expressive/NN of/IN the/DT greatest/JJS benevolence/NN ;/: a/DT few/JJ gray/JJ hairs/NNS covered/VBD his/PRP$ tem-/JJ ples/NNS ,/, but/CC those/DT at/IN the/DT back/NN of/IN his/PRP$ head/NN were/VBD nearly/RB black/JJ ./. 
His/PRP$ person/NN was/VBD short/JJ ,/, but/CC remarkably/RB erect/VBP ;/: and/CC his/PRP$ voice/NN the/DT sweetest/JJS I/PRP had/VBD ever/RB heard/VBN ./. 
He/PRP began/VBD his/PRP$ lecture/NN by/IN a/DT recapitulation/NN of/IN the/DT history/NN of/IN chemistry/NN and/CC the/DT various/JJ im-/JJ provements/NNS made/VBN by/IN different/JJ men/NNS of/IN learning/NN ,/, pronouncing/VBG with/IN fervour/PDT the/DT names/NNS of/IN the/DT most/RBS distinguished/JJ discover-/JJ ers/NNS ./. 
He/PRP then/RB took/VBD a/DT cursory/JJ view/NN of/IN the/DT present/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT science/NN ,/, and/CC explained/VBD many/JJ of/IN its/PRP$ elementary/JJ terms/NNS ./. 
After/IN having/VBG made/VBN a/DT few/JJ preparatory/NN experiments/NNS ,/, he/PRP concluded/VBD with/IN a/DT panegyric/JJ upon/NN modern/JJ chemistry/NN ,/, the/DT terms/NNS of/IN which/WDT I/PRP shall/MD never/RB forget/VB :/: —/NN ''/'' The/DT ancient/JJ teachers/NNS of/IN this/DT science/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD he/PRP ,/, ``/`` prom-/NN ised/JJ impossibilities/NNS ,/, and/CC performed/VBD nothing/NN ./. 
The/DT modern/JJ masters/NNS promise/VBP very/RB little/JJ ;/: they/PRP know/VBP that/IN metals/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB transmuted/VBN ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT elixir/NN of/IN life/NN is/VBZ a/DT chimera/NN ./. 
But/CC these/DT philosophers/NNS ,/, whose/WP$ hands/NNS seem/VBP only/RB made/VBN to/TO dabble/VB in/IN dirt/NN ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ eyes/NNS to/TO pour/VB over/IN the/DT microscope/NN or/CC crucible/JJ ,/, have/VBP indeed/RB performed/VBN miracles/NNS ./. 
They/PRP penetrate/VBP into/IN the/DT recesses/NNS of/IN nature/NN ,/, and/CC shew/VB how/WRB she/PRP works/VBZ in/IN her/PRP$ hiding/NN places/NNS ./. 
They/PRP ascend/VBP into/IN the/DT heavens/NNS ;/: they/PRP have/VBP discovered/VBN how/WRB the/DT blood/NN circulates/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT nature/NN of/IN the/DT air/NN we/PRP breathe/VBP ./.

I/PRP departed/VBD highly/RB pleased/JJ with/IN the/DT professor/NN and/CC his/PRP$ lec-/JJ ture/NN ,/, and/CC paid/VBD him/PRP a/DT visit/NN the/DT same/JJ evening/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ manners/NNS in/IN private/JJ were/VBD even/RB more/JJR mild/JJ and/CC attractive/JJ than/IN in/IN public/JJ ;/: for/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT certain/JJ dignity/NN in/IN his/PRP$ mien/NN during/IN his/PRP$ lec-/JJ ture/NN ,/, which/WDT in/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ house/NN was/VBD replaced/VBN by/IN the/DT greatest/JJS affability/NN and/CC kindness/NN ./.

He/PRP said/VBD ,/, that/IN ``/`` these/DT were/VBD men/NNS to/TO whose/WP$ indefatigable/JJ zeal/NN modern/JJ philosophers/NNS were/VBD indebted/VBN for/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT foundations/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ knowledge/NN ./.

I/PRP listened/VBD to/TO his/PRP$ statement/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD delivered/VBN without/IN any/DT presumption/NN or/CC affectation/NN ;/: and/CC then/RB added/VBD ,/, that/IN his/PRP$ lecture/NN had/VBD removed/VBN my/PRP$ prejudices/NNS against/IN modern/JJ chemists/NNS ;/: and/CC I/PRP ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, requested/VBD his/PRP$ advice/NN concerning/VBG the/DT books/NNS I/PRP ought/MD to/TO procure/VB ./. 
``/`` I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ ,/, ''/'' said/VBD M./NNP Waldman/NNP ,/, ``/`` to/TO have/VB gained/VBN a/DT dis-/JJ ciple/NN ;/: and/CC if/IN your/PRP$ application/NN equals/NNS your/PRP$ ability/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP no/DT doubt/NN of/IN your/PRP$ success/NN ./.

''/'' 
He/PRP then/RB took/VBD me/PRP into/IN his/PRP$ laboratory/NN ,/, and/CC explained/VBD to/TO me/PRP the/DT uses/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ various/JJ machines/NNS ;/: instructing/VBG me/PRP as/IN to/TO what/WP I/PRP ought/MD to/TO procure/VB ,/, and/CC promising/VBG me/PRP the/DT use/NN of/IN his/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, when/WRB I/PRP should/MD have/VB advanced/VBN far/RB enough/RB in/IN the/DT science/NN not/RB to/TO derange/VB their/PRP$ mechanism/NN ./.

Thus/RB ended/VBD a/DT day/NN memorable/JJ to/TO me/PRP ;/: it/PRP decided/VBD my/PRP$ future/NN destiny/NN ./. 
From/IN this/DT day/NN natural/JJ philosophy/NN ,/, and/CC particularly/RB chemistry/NN in/IN the/DT most/RBS comprehensive/JJ sense/NN of/IN the/DT term/NN ,/, became/VBD nearly/RB my/PRP$ sole/JJ occupation/NN ./. 
I/PRP read/VBP with/IN ardour/NNS those/DT works/NNS ,/, so/IN full/JJ of/IN genius/NN and/CC discrimination/NN ,/, which/WDT modern/VBP inquirers/NNS have/VBP writ-/JJ ten/NNS on/IN these/DT subjects/NNS ./.

In/IN M./NNP Waldman/NNP I/PRP found/VBD a/DT true/JJ friend/NN ./. 
His/PRP$ gentleness/NN was/VBD never/RB tinged/VBN by/IN dogmatism/NN ;/: and/CC his/PRP$ instructions/NNS were/VBD given/VBN with/IN an/DT air/NN of/IN frankness/NN and/CC good/JJ nature/NN ,/, that/IN ban-/JJ ished/JJ every/DT idea/NN of/IN pedantry/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD ,/, perhaps/RB ,/, the/DT amiable/JJ character/NN of/IN this/DT man/NN that/WDT inclined/VBD me/PRP more/RBR to/TO that/DT branch/NN of/IN natural/JJ philosophy/NN which/WDT he/PRP professed/VBD ,/, than/IN an/DT intrinsic/JJ love/NN for/IN the/DT science/NN itself/PRP ./. 
But/CC this/DT state/NN of/IN mind/NN had/VBD place/NN only/RB in/IN the/DT first/JJ steps/NNS towards/NNS knowledge/NN :/: the/DT more/RBR fully/RB I/PRP entered/VBD into/IN the/DT science/NN ,/, the/DT more/RBR exclusively/RB I/PRP pursued/VBD it/PRP for/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ sake/NN ./.

The/DT astonishment/NN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD at/IN first/JJ experienced/VBN on/IN this/DT discovery/NN soon/RB gave/VBD place/NN to/TO delight/VB and/CC rapture/NN ./. 
After/IN so/RB much/JJ time/NN spent/VBN in/IN painful/JJ labour/NN ,/, to/TO arrive/VB at/IN once/RB at/IN the/DT summit/NN of/IN my/PRP$ desires/NNS ,/, was/VBD the/DT most/RBS gratifying/JJ consummation/NN of/IN my/PRP$ toils/NNS ./. 
But/CC this/DT discovery/NN was/VBD so/RB great/JJ and/CC overwhelm-/JJ ing/NN ,/, that/IN all/PDT the/DT steps/NNS by/IN which/WDT I/PRP had/VBD been/VBN progressively/RB led/VBN to/TO it/PRP were/VBD obliterated/VBN ,/, and/CC I/PRP beheld/VBP only/RB the/DT result/NN ./. 
What/WP had/VBD been/VBN the/DT study/NN and/CC desire/NN of/IN the/DT wisest/JJS men/NNS since/IN the/DT cre-/JJ ation/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, was/VBD now/RB within/IN my/PRP$ grasp/NN ./. 
Not/RB that/IN ,/, like/IN a/DT magic/JJ scene/NN ,/, it/PRP all/DT opened/VBD upon/IN me/PRP at/IN once/RB :/: the/DT information/NN I/PRP had/VBD obtained/VBN was/VBD of/IN a/DT nature/NN rather/RB to/TO direct/VB my/PRP$ endeavours/NNS so/RB soon/RB as/IN I/PRP should/MD point/VB them/PRP towards/IN the/DT object/NN of/IN my/PRP$ search/NN ,/, than/IN to/TO exhibit/VB that/DT object/VBP already/RB accomplished/VBN ./. 
I/PRP was/VBD like/IN the/DT Arabian/NNP who/WP had/VBD been/VBN buried/VBN with/IN the/DT dead/JJ ,/, and/CC found/VBD a/DT passage/NN to/TO life/NN aided/VBN only/RB by/IN one/CD glimmering/NN ,/, and/CC seemingly/RB ineffectual/JJ light/NN ./. 
When/WRB I/PRP found/VBD so/RB astonishing/VBG a/DT power/NN placed/VBN within/IN my/PRP$ hands/NNS ,/, I/PRP hesitated/VBD a/DT long/JJ time/NN concerning/VBG the/DT manner/NN in/IN which/WDT I/PRP should/MD employ/VB it/PRP ./. 
Although/IN I/PRP possessed/VBD the/DT capacity/NN of/IN bestowing/VBG animation/NN ,/, yet/RB to/TO prepare/VB a/DT frame/NN for/IN the/DT recep-/JJ tion/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, with/IN all/DT its/PRP$ intricacies/NNS of/IN fibres/NNS ,/, muscles/NNS ,/, and/CC veins/NNS ,/, still/RB remained/VBD a/DT work/NN of/IN inconceivable/JJ difficulty/NN and/CC labour/NN ./. 
I/PRP doubted/VBD at/IN first/JJ whether/IN I/PRP should/MD attempt/VB the/DT creation/NN of/IN a/DT being/VBG like/IN myself/PRP or/CC one/CD of/IN simpler/NN organization/NN ;/: but/CC my/PRP$ imagination/NN was/VBD too/RB much/JJ exalted/VBN by/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ success/NN to/TO permit/VB me/PRP to/TO doubt/VB of/IN my/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO give/VB life/NN to/TO an/DT animal/NN as/IN complex/JJ and/CC wonderful/JJ as/IN man/NN ./. 
The/DT materials/NNS at/IN present/NN within/IN my/PRP$ command/NN hardly/RB appeared/VBD adequate/JJ to/TO so/RB ardu-/JJ ous/JJ an/DT undertaking/NN ;/: but/CC I/PRP doubted/VBD not/RB that/IN I/PRP should/MD ultimately/RB succeed/VB ./. 
I/PRP prepared/VBD myself/PRP for/IN a/DT multitude/NN of/IN reverses/NNS ;/: my/PRP$ operations/NNS might/MD be/VB incessantly/RB baffled/VBN ,/, and/CC at/IN last/JJ my/PRP$ work/NN be/VB imperfect/JJ :/: yet/RB ,/, when/WRB I/PRP considered/VBD the/DT improvement/NN which/WDT every/DT day/NN takes/VBZ place/NN in/IN science/NN and/CC mechanics/NNS ,/, I/PRP was/VBD en-/RB couraged/VBN to/TO hope/VB my/PRP$ present/JJ attempts/NNS would/MD at/IN least/JJS lay/VB the/DT foundations/NNS of/IN future/JJ success/NN ./. 
Nor/CC could/MD I/PRP consider/VB the/DT magnitude/NN and/CC complexity/NN of/IN my/PRP$ plan/NN as/IN any/DT argument/NN of/IN its/PRP$ impracticability/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD with/IN these/DT feelings/NNS that/IN I/PRP began/VBD the/DT creation/NN of/IN a/DT human/JJ being/VBG ./. 
As/IN the/DT minuteness/NN of/IN the/DT parts/NNS formed/VBD a/DT great/JJ hindrance/NN to/TO my/PRP$ speed/NN ,/, I/PRP resolved/VBD ,/, contrary/JJ to/TO my/PRP$ first/JJ intention/NN ,/, to/TO make/VB the/DT being/VBG of/IN a/DT gigantic/JJ stature/NN ;/: that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO say/VB ,/, about/RB eight/CD feet/NNS in/IN height/NN ,/, and/CC proportionably/RB large/JJ ./. 
After/IN having/VBG formed/VBN this/DT determination/NN ,/, and/CC having/VBG spent/VBN some/DT months/NNS in/IN successfully/RB collecting/VBG and/CC arranging/VBG my/PRP$ materials/NNS ,/, I/PRP began/VBD ./. 
The/DT summer/NN months/NNS passed/VBN while/IN I/PRP was/VBD thus/RB engaged/VBN ,/, heart/NN and/CC soul/NN ,/, in/IN one/CD pursuit/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD a/DT most/RBS beautiful/JJ sea-/JJ son/NN ;/: never/RB did/VBD the/DT fields/NNS bestow/VBD a/DT more/RBR plentiful/JJ harvest/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT vines/NNS yield/VBP a/DT more/RBR luxuriant/JJ vintage/NN :/: but/CC my/PRP$ eyes/NNS were/VBD insensible/JJ to/TO the/DT charms/NNS of/IN nature/NN ./. 
And/CC the/DT same/JJ feelings/NNS which/WDT made/VBD me/PRP neglect/VB the/DT scenes/NNS around/IN me/PRP caused/VBD me/PRP also/RB to/TO forget/VB those/DT friends/NNS who/WP were/VBD so/RB many/JJ miles/NNS absent/RB ,/, and/CC whom/WP I/PRP had/VBD not/RB seen/VBN for/IN so/RB long/RB a/DT time/NN ./. 
I/PRP knew/VBD my/PRP$ silence/NN disquieted/VBD them/PRP ;/: and/CC I/PRP well/RB remembered/VBD the/DT words/NNS of/IN my/PRP$ father/NN :/: ``/`` I/PRP know/VBP that/IN while/IN you/PRP are/VBP pleased/JJ with/IN yourself/PRP ,/, you/PRP will/MD think/VB of/IN us/PRP with/IN affection/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP shall/MD hear/VB regularly/RB from/IN you/PRP ./.

It/PRP was/VBD on/IN a/DT dreary/JJ night/NN of/IN November/NNP ,/, that/IN I/PRP beheld/VBD the/DT accomplishment/NN of/IN my/PRP$ toils/NNS ./. 
With/IN an/DT anxiety/NN that/WDT almost/RB amounted/VBD to/TO agony/VB ,/, I/PRP collected/VBD the/DT instruments/NNS of/IN life/NN around/IN me/PRP ,/, that/IN I/PRP might/MD infuse/VB a/DT spark/NN of/IN being/VBG into/IN the/DT lifeless/JJ thing/NN that/WDT lay/VBD at/IN my/PRP$ feet/NNS ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD already/RB one/CD in/IN the/DT morn-/JJ ing/NN ;/: the/DT rain/NN pattered/VBD dismally/RB against/IN the/DT panes/NNS ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ candle/NN was/VBD nearly/RB burnt/VBN out/RP ,/, when/WRB ,/, by/IN the/DT glimmer/NN of/IN the/DT half-extinguished/JJ light/NN ,/, I/PRP saw/VBD the/DT dull/JJ yellow/JJ eye/NN of/IN the/DT crea-/JJ ture/NN open/JJ ;/: it/PRP breathed/VBD hard/RB ,/, and/CC a/DT convulsive/JJ motion/NN agitated/VBD its/PRP$ limbs/NNS ./.

His/PRP$ yellow/JJ skin/NN scarcely/RB covered/VBD the/DT work/NN of/IN muscles/NNS and/CC arteries/NNS beneath/VBP ;/: his/PRP$ hair/NN was/VBD of/IN a/DT lustrous/JJ black/JJ ,/, and/CC flowing/VBG ;/: his/PRP$ teeth/NNS of/IN a/DT pearly/JJ whiteness/NN ;/: but/CC these/DT luxuriances/NNS only/RB formed/VBD a/DT more/RBR horrid/JJ contrast/NN with/IN his/PRP$ wa-/JJ tery/NN eyes/NNS ,/, that/WDT seemed/VBD almost/RB of/IN the/DT same/JJ colour/NN as/IN the/DT dun/NN white/JJ sockets/NNS in/IN which/WDT they/PRP were/VBD set/VBN ,/, his/PRP$ shrivelled/JJ complex-/JJ ion/NN ,/, and/CC straight/JJ black/JJ lips/NNS ./.

A/DT mummy/NN again/RB endued/VBN with/IN animation/NN could/MD not/RB be/VB so/RB hideous/JJ as/IN that/DT wretch/NN ./. 
I/PRP had/VBD gazed/VBN on/IN him/PRP while/IN unfinished/VBN ;/: he/PRP was/VBD ugly/RB then/RB ;/: but/CC when/WRB those/DT muscles/NNS and/CC joints/NNS were/VBD rendered/VBN capable/JJ of/IN motion/NN ,/, it/PRP became/VBD a/DT thing/NN such/JJ as/IN even/RB Dante/NNP could/MD not/RB have/VB conceived/VBN ./. 
I/PRP passed/VBD the/DT night/NN wretchedly/RB ./.

The/DT porter/NN opened/VBD the/DT gates/NNS of/IN the/DT court/NN ,/, which/WDT had/VBD that/IN night/NN been/VBN my/PRP$ asylum/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP issued/VBD into/IN the/DT streets/NNS ,/, pac-/JJ ing/VBG them/PRP with/IN quick/JJ steps/NNS ,/, as/IN if/IN I/PRP sought/VBD to/TO avoid/VB the/DT wretch/NN whom/WP I/PRP feared/VBD every/DT turning/NN of/IN the/DT street/NN would/MD present/VB to/TO my/PRP$ view/NN ./.

This/DT benefit/NN was/VBD fully/RB repaid/VBN ;/: Justine/NNP was/VBD the/DT most/RBS grateful/JJ little/JJ creature/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN :/: I/PRP do/VBP not/RB mean/VB that/IN she/PRP made/VBD any/DT professions/NNS ,/, I/PRP never/RB heard/VBD one/CD pass/NN her/PRP$ lips/NNS ;/: but/CC you/PRP could/MD see/VB by/IN her/PRP$ eyes/NNS that/IN she/PRP almost/RB adored/VBD her/PRP$ protectress/NN ./.

Two/CD years/NNS had/VBD now/RB nearly/RB elapsed/VBN since/IN the/DT night/NN on/IN which/WDT he/PRP first/RB received/VBD life/NN ;/: and/CC was/VBD this/DT his/PRP$ first/JJ crime/NN ?/.

The/DT gates/NNS were/VBD open/JJ ;/: and/CC I/PRP hastened/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ father/NN 's/POS house/NN ./. 
My/PRP$ first/JJ thought/NN was/VBD to/TO discover/VB what/WP I/PRP knew/VBD of/IN the/DT murderer/NN ,/, and/CC cause/NN instant/JJ pursuit/NN to/TO be/VB made/VBN ./.

A/DT being/VBG whom/WP I/PRP myself/PRP had/VBD formed/VBN ,/, and/CC endued/VBN with/IN life/NN ,/, had/VBD met/VBN me/PRP at/IN midnight/NN among/IN the/DT precipices/NNS of/IN an/DT inaccessible/JJ mountain/NN ./.

These/DT reflections/NNS determined/VBD me/PRP ,/, and/CC I/PRP resolved/VBD to/TO remain/VB silent/JJ ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD about/RB five/CD in/IN the/DT morning/NN when/WRB I/PRP entered/VBD my/PRP$ father/NN 's/POS house/NN ./.

Six/CD years/NNS had/VBD elapsed/VBN ,/, passed/VBN as/IN a/DT dream/NN but/CC for/IN one/CD indelible/JJ trace/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP stood/VBD in/IN the/DT same/JJ place/NN where/WRB I/PRP had/VBD last/JJ embraced/JJ my/PRP$ father/NN before/IN my/PRP$ departure/NN for/IN Ingolstadt/NNP ./.

He/PRP still/RB remained/VBD to/TO me/PRP ./. 
I/PRP gazed/VBD on/IN the/DT picture/NN of/IN my/PRP$ mother/NN ,/, which/WDT stood/VBD over/IN the/DT mantle-piece/NN ./. 
It/PRP was/VBD an/DT historical/JJ subject/NN ,/, painted/VBN at/IN my/PRP$ father/NN 's/POS desire/NN ,/, and/CC represented/VBD Caroline/NNP Beaufort/NNP in/IN an/DT agony/NN of/IN despair/NN ,/, kneeling/VBG by/IN the/DT coffin/NN of/IN her/PRP$ dead/JJ father/NN ./. 
Her/PRP$ garb/NN was/VBD rustic/JJ ,/, and/CC her/PRP$ cheek/JJ pale/NN ;/: but/CC there/EX was/VBD an/DT air/NN of/IN dignity/NN and/CC beauty/NN ,/, that/WDT hardly/RB permitted/VBD the/DT sentiment/NN of/IN pity/NN ./.
