Kevin Schumacher:
	I was mainly in charge of testing the connection between the website and the python program.  To test the link between the website and the python program I would type in a word or two into the textbox and click the button.  If everything was working well whatever I typed into the textbox would print out a couple lines below the button, otherwise some error code would print out.  In addition to this I used the consul in Safari figure out what was being called and what errors might have happened.

Alexandra Tutino:
	I was mainly in charge of creating the website. To test the code, I would try to run the website on my web browser. I would see what errors would come up on the browser, and I would go back to the code to fix it. If everything was working well, I would be able to see what I tried to implement into the website. When the website worked, I would be able to see all the images, the textarea, all the text directly on the website, the boxes where the statistics would be shown, the links to the wikipedia pages, and the links would be functional. I also helped implement this website into the website that Ray and Kevin were using that used flask, by finding errors that would show up after the implementation and helping figure out how to fix them. I also helped with the preprocessing, by finding author samples and placing them into a text file that could be analyzed. I also typed out the Release Plan, the Sprint Plans, the Sprint out the Release Plan, the Sprint Plans, the Sprint out the Release Plan, the Sprint Plans, the Sprint Reports, most of the Working Prototype document, and most of the System Unit Test documents. I used the templates to write them, and I made changes to them based on what our TA Dylan said.

Mikhail Kouzminov: 
	I was in charge of creating the machine learning program and allowing saving and loading of the pickle file, and writing the code to integrate with the text analysis of the user data. In order to accomplish this, I ran my code on several test files sent to me by Priya, including making multiple attempts to read the CSV file and properly separate classified data from classification data, testing each attempt with a print statement, and using PyCharm SDK along the way. I then tested the effectiveness of several types of machine learning, testing the accuracy on  subsections of the authorsâ€™ writing until it correctly classified 60% of the samples. Once I did that, I tested to ensure the pickle file saving and loading worked properly by again running and saving the trained model, then classifying a separate input line after loading the file.

Priya Padmanaban:
	I was in charge of the text processing and managing input and output for the integrated machine learning and text processing. I produced statistics for 13 author samples, which was fed into a CSV file and used by Misha to build the machine learning model. Then, once the model was complete, I refined my program to produce statistics for user samples and output the data points that needed to be displayed as well as the resulting author the model picked. To test, I used shorter samples that had expected statistics and compared my results against that. Once integration was complete, I tested other works by the same authors to see if they were recognized. I also did some QA testing by running the processing program with files containing special characters, unacceptable file types, and odd whitespace characters.

Ka Wai Lee (Ray):
	I was mainly in charge of author sample, and partly in charge in integration between website and python code. To test the linkage between the html and python is hard to do without checking it line by line and checking the format of both. For example, displaying image in html and flask in python is totally different. We need to put the image file in different location for each of them. One way to test and fix the bugs is from the info we got from the console and we can know where the information passed to python and send it back to html as we want. Once we figured the problem, we can focus on specific part in our code. Also we can use print statement to show if we are getting the correct result or data.
